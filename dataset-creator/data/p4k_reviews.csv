King Princess,Cheap Queen,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=pop"">Pop/R&amp;B</a>","By now, Mikaela Straus’ artistic predicament has become uncannily familiar: A young unknown with a fresh, infectious sound releases a song that catches fire. Streams rack up, fame arrives overnight; the pressure’s on to articulate an artistic identity, cook up a debut album, and make good on the promise of that first hit, fast—all while contending with the gaze of several million curious onlookers. If Straus, who’s better known as King Princess, wanted to compare notes on the ups and downs of a viral breakout, she could do so with a fairly spectacular peer group that includes Maggie Rogers, Billie Eilish, and Clairo.Straus’ story has an added layer of complexity. Last year, the 20-year-old singer-songwriter rose up on the shoulders of her song “1950,” a sticky, Harry Styles-cosigned debut that took inspiration from classic queer literature and opened with a nod to her sexual orientation: “I hate it when dudes try to chase me.” On its heels came “Talia,” a bit of liquor-wet, post-breakup revelry directed to a conspicuously female subject, and the self-explanatory single “Pussy Is God.” Within months, King Princess was not just a burgeoning pop phenom, but a burgeoning queer idol.In the historically sanitized landscape of pop music, queer expression is undeniably radical, particularly how Straus does it—by naming and gendering her desire in a way that, not long ago, few dared to. And if Straus is fazed by the burden of representation, she doesn’t show it. Her debut album—that first true test of her artistry—is titled Cheap Queen, borrowing a term from drag culture, and on its cover, she appears with her face done up in drag queen glam, down to the painted-on beauty mark. The title track, she says, is a tribute to her squad, all cheap queens in their own right. (Straus, whose father runs Brooklyn’s Mission Sound studio, inherited a leg up in the industry, so it’s a bit cheeky of her to make a personal brand of scrappiness—but then, cheekiness is part of her brand, too.) Like any good pop song, “Cheap Queen” strikes a balance between specificity and relatability. It shouts out its community without wading into identity politics, instead cultivating, through its inclusive warmth and effortless swagger, a stoner-pop appeal likely to resonate with anyone who’s ever stayed up drinking and smoking with pals.Thematically, though, “Cheap Queen”—originally one of the album’s sharp, economical interludes, until Straus’ team persuaded her to expand it—stands apart. On the whole, the album is more concerned with lovers than with friends. Sequenced as a chronological narrative, Cheap Queen loosely follows a fraught renegotiation of space between exes; the particulars aren’t quite so interesting as the emotions they draw out. Straus has noted her eagerness to “write about getting my heart smashed,” and she repeatedly delivers on the drama of that declaration. “Homegirl,” a schmaltzy, vibraphone-embellished ballad, tracks the triangulation of glances between Straus and the boys who are eyeing the same woman at a party—the kind of gathering where close quarters reveal vast emotional distance. The gulf between Straus and her love interest widens as she considers forgotten possessions unlikely to be reclaimed (“Isabel’s Moment”) and nervously awaits a text unlikely to arrive (“Watching My Phone”).The latter song’s clincher is an admission of inadequacy: “I can’t be the million girls you’re going to meet.” The meekness is gutting; its narrator is barely recognizable as the same person who earlier claimed to be “getting too cocky, since everyone wants me,” who wrote off her ex with a sweetly condescending, “You’re probably just a fan now, babe.” But embracing opposing energies is the King Princess way. She is confident and vulnerable, cool and earnest. As her chosen moniker suggests, she’s masculine and feminine, swaggering and soft, posing for Playboy as both cheerleader and jock. She’s posing for Playboy, a bastion of the male gaze that her widely broadcasted sexuality belies.In particular, Cheap Queen plays on a tension between old and new. Straus and her Gen-Z peers grew up listening to Drake, Beyoncé, and Taylor Swift, but Straus’ industry-adjacent upbringing also exposed her to ’70s rock bands including Led Zeppelin and T. Rex. Like Styles, who helped precipitate her fame, she seems eager to cut her modern pop sensibility with doses of historicism. On Cheap Queen, the drum pads and Auto-Tune harmonics that defined her first singles are still part of the mix, but the computer isn’t her primary tool. There’s a hint of Janis Joplin when Straus layers in blues guitar and organ or teases the occasional snarl out of her otherwise silky voice. Latter-day rock prophet Father John Misty drops by to handle drums on “Ain’t Together,” a crisp, handsome tune with Beatles-esque eccentricity in its (digitally approximated) Mellotron fills and densely layered backing vocals.Still, Straus is a distinctly contemporary creator, versed in samples and pitch-shifts and interludes—songs as short as post-digital attention spans—that house some of her most intriguing musical ideas. To the extent that viral success is explicable, it seems sensible that hers continues to hold. As Cheap Queen makes plain, she’s not an ingénue with one great idea—she has a few dozen of them, informed by sources spanning decades and genres. There are moments when she slips up—“Watching My Phone,” with its lugubrious strings and wistful choral embellishments, feels particularly overworked—and she isn’t breaking ground in pop by disregarding its supposed borders. But where post-genre stream-baiters pull their numbers by anesthetizing distinctive sounds, King Princess pulls hers by playing up their contrasts.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-28,7.4
Donato Dozzy,12H,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=electronic"">Electronic</a>","For over 15 years, Italian producer Donato Dozzy has masterfully ranged from tech house to trance to straight techno. But at his core, he is a minimalist, gleefully finding the strangest, most archaic element to zoom in on, turning any mole hill into Monte Bianco. His beatific ambient techno collaboration with fellow producer Neel, 2012’s Voices From the Lake, took as its starting point a single incident, a live set to be performed at Japan’s infamous Labyrinth festival. And in the past few years, Dozzy’s zoomed in even further, relentlessly exploring every imaginable facet of the mouth harp, the 303, and Anna Caragnano’s singing voice across full-length albums.So it makes a certain kind of sense that a single object lies at the heart of his latest epic, 12H: the Armando Trovajoli - Music Bridge in Rome. While plans for the structure date back to 1929, the bridge was only completed in 2008. It’s the lone steel bridge that runs over the River Tiber into the historic center of Rome. This release on Lorenzo Senni’s Presto!? label is culled from material that Dozzy recorded and assembled for a sound installation designed for 24 speakers that ran the length of the colonnade of the bridge. 12H clocks in at almost 100 minutes, at times evoking the immersive, exquisitely detailed ambience of Voices from the Lake, but without the same breathtaking vistas and sumptuous peaks.The set opens with Dozzy in resplendent, shimmering ambient mode, all body-dissolving washes, tingling small bells, electronics that mimic the sound of frogs at night, and slow-moving arpeggios. Other elements pop up, like running water and clattering wind chimes, before “12H.3” introduces a gentle pulse and quivering synth line, only to have it splash back into gurgly water sounds and electronics.A magnificent highlight comes on “12H.5,” which could be a leftover from Sintetizzatrice, his collaboration with Caragnano. The track painstakingly layers her gossamer breaths, building a sigh into a skyscraper.  As that piece dissipates, the first smattering of percussion finally enters, nearly 45 minutes into the album, the hand drums pinging about the stereo field like a gentle tribute to E2-E4. Usually when drums enter Dozzy’s mixes, they elevate the proceedings to an unimaginable new high. Here, they don’t really add much in the way of emotion or release.The throbs of “12H.8” soon get submerged by field recordings of insects rustling in the distance. The metallic thrums and acid stabs that punctuate “12H.9” are texturally intriguing, though they too soon fall to the wayside. We’re left to wonder what it might have sounded like had Dozzy pushed a few elements further or higher (as when Dozzy dropped a masterful techno rework of “12H.5” as a single earlier this year), rather than let the strictures of minimalism tamp everything down. The sounds of bridge traffic dovetail nicely with 12H’s kosmische-esque closing track, but like most urban congestion problems, it just takes far too long to get there.",2019-10-28,6.8
Cigarettes After Sex,Cry,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=experimental"">Experimental</a>","It feels almost like a novelty these days for a dude to write an album entirely about being extremely horny. Men don’t make music about sex the way they used to. We are far past the epoch of Serge Gainsbourg writing pop songs that involved Jane Birkin or Brigitte Bardot mimicking the sounds of orgasm. People have more or less collectively agreed that rendering women as pure sex objects in music doesn’t need to happen so much anymore. Greg Gonzalez, the frontman of the noir dream-pop band Cigarettes After Sex, must not have gotten the memo. He operates within a space of midcentury sexual anachronism. His second record, Cry, is a 41-minute dream about Penthouse pets and women in silken underthings, filtered through chiaroscuro and top-shelf whiskey. There is a universe where this raciness could conceivably offer a reprieve from indie rock’s occasional prudishness. Unfortunately, Gonzalez’s candor about his desire comes off as lifeless and borderline asinine.This is clear from the first play of the record. The bleak textures, like those of the band’s debut, have been airlifted from the darkest corners of dream-pop music. There are notes of Violet Indiana and the Verve circa A Storm in Heaven, as well as more obvious tips of the hat to Angelo Badalamenti and David Lynch. “Kiss It Off Me,” the album’s second song, uses subterranean synth parts that are uncannily similar to the ones on the Twin Peaks soundtrack. The intrigue and Lynchian darkness pretty much stop once we meet the apple of Gonzalez’s eye, a protagonist as two-dimensional as a piece of paper peeling off a picnic table in a light breeze. “I could see you were walking slow/Drinking a Slurpee/In a peach baseball cap/Falling in my lap/You were so thirsty,” Gonzalez sings, with unearned wistfulness. He yearns to make her forget about “all of those rich fuckboys” she tends to date, and by the end of the song, she’s biting her lip and begging for it before she heads off to the gym in the morning. If there is anything romantic about this encounter, it is washed away by the song’s utter inability to deviate from overused ’90s pastiche—or, more importantly, to represent the woman in question as anything other than some chick who loves to work out and have sex.Then there’s “Hentai,” a song that’s literally about anime porn. Specifically, about a hentai video he described to his paramour the first time they “made love,” about “a girl who as soon as she made you come/Could show you the future and tell you your fortune.” The scene setting could almost be funny, but there’s scant irony in Gonzalez’s delivery. The sound of the song is as delicate as an antique plate gathering dust on a shelf: High notes on electric guitars are languidly plucked, and the bassline is a slow IV drip that gives you goosebumps. Then there’s the question of Gonzalez’s voice, a truly lovely and androgynous tenor that’s wasted on lines like these. You could lose yourself in the sound, if losing yourself is akin to collapsing on an overly plush bed. “Pure” is an equally banal and pornographic sketch of a song. Here, Gonzalez’s woman wears a white bodysuit and has wet hair.  Long story short, she goes down on him, and then they go stare out the window but all he can think about is how he got to see her naked. It’s the album’s closer, but it’s likely to leave you feeling nothing, other than perhaps blunted anger.Cry doesn’t evoke much in the name of passion. Unless, of course, passion is the same thing as wafting through depression, and sex is the means to fill that void. There is nothing wry about the way Gonzalez writes about sex. The album has almost zero sense of humor and is deadly serious in its execution. It’s important to write about sex on one’s own terms, and there are plenty of compelling ways to explore sexuality in song. The problem here is that the narrative of this record is essentially one giant, dull, and gross fantasy plucked from adolescent male puberty. It presents a vision of sex that comes from surfing Pornhub after school before your parents get home from work, and from looking at pictures of minimally clad Instagram influencers while waiting in line to get a flu shot. Gonzalez’s attempt to be honest about his experiences is far removed from the reality of what it is like to be sexually vulnerable in front of another person. Cry is a soulless and Styrofoam record as hollow as a booty-call text at 3 a.m. “Hey sexy, you up?” the record seems to beckon. It’s hardly an inviting proposition.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-28,4.0
Ali Barter,"Hello, I’m Doing My Best","<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=pop"">Pop/R&amp;B</a>","Though happily married and sober, Melbourne songwriter and guitarist Ali Barter wouldn’t dare write about anything so peaceful. Barter’s muse is the thrilling turbulence of young adulthood, and the lasting resonance of the bad decisions one makes in their early 20s. On her new record Hello, I’m Doing My Best, these themes coalesce with the confidence and immediacy of 2000s pop-rock. The result is an emotionally nuanced album that never takes itself too seriously.Barter’s debut, 2017’s A Suitable Girl, was a lovably slapdash collection of, in the words of one beloved teen film, “angry girl music of the indie-rock persuasion”—feminist pop-rock that angled for everywoman relatability. That formula worked well for Barter, with the singles “Girlie Bits” and “Cigarette” achieving modest success in her home country. Many of the songs on A Suitable Girl, though, suffered from a certain anonymity. Her bid for universality resulted in lines like “What’s a woman made of?/Something glorious”—well-intentioned but nevertheless a little hackneyed.Hello, I’m Doing My Best makes no such attempts, instead leaning full-tilt into Barter’s loose-cannon instincts. She draws herself as an indie rock Fleabag, a self-deprecating and hard-drinking flirt who texts her crushes at 3 a.m. and listens to “Malibu” to get through the hangover the next morning. From its earliest moments—the Hole reference comes in the very first line—Hello, I’m Doing My Best is appealingly frank. “Ur a Piece of Shit,” the second track, is a bombastic love letter to a friend in crisis: “You got your daddy issues,” Barter sings. “It made you real suspicious/That’s why you hacked in his account.” She wastes no time with poetics, and while it’s a risky move—she ends up rhyming “drugs” with “drugs”—it displays a kind of gonzo commitment to the album’s messy, diaristic heart.With loud and unadorned production, Hello, I’m Doing My Best taps into a current of emotive, candid pop-rock typified by the Josie and the Pussycats soundtrack and currently practiced by the likes of Charly Bliss and Bully. There’s not an ounce of crunch or grit here, just clean, sanded-down edges and lacquered finishes. The production—handled by Barter’s husband, Oscar Dawson of the band Holy Holy—adds an early-2000s patina, giving the record the pleasing accessibility of teen classics like Avril Lavigne’s Let Go.Hello, I’m Doing My Best often reads as a guidebook for young adults learning to navigate the world, and in that light, Barter’s no-bullshit lyricism is punkish and endearing. On “Ur a Piece of Shit,” for example, she gleefully calls on listeners to “put your hands up” for various messed-up teenage experiences, like “eating disorders,” “if a doctor touched you,” and “if it felt good to cut yourself.” In moments like these, Barter resembles a young Liz Phair, writing with a shamelessness that few songwriters since have really relished. Lines like, “I heard you like Tool, yeah/And you got really cool hair/And I think that you should be my boyfriend” feel directly indebted to Phair, and the chorus of “History of Boys” (“I used to get drunk and blackout/I used to get drunk and tell you I need you”), while hewing closer to pop than anything Phair wrote in her early days, owes its gutsiness to her.It helps that Barter never lets a linear personal narrative define these songs. The only time she writes about her now-husband, on “Backseat,” she revisits a time before they met, hinting at the future by declaring that “we’d be perrrrrfect” alongside a grandiose Guitar Hero-style solo. “January,” a dejected highlight on an otherwise frenetic album, stops in at one of life’s Sisyphean checkpoints: the hope of magically becoming a better person come New Year’s Day. “I made it through the year again with Diet Coke and cigarettes,” she sings. It could be any year; life, Barter seems to say, runs on a loop, and despite all we think we’ve learned, no amount of personal growth is certain to prevent mistakes. Even hindsight rarely makes everything clear. At least Hello, I’m Doing My Best makes it sound like a blast.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-28,7.2
Germs,(GI),"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","Trying to get the straight story of Los Angeles punk band Germs is like trying to piece together the timeline of a debaucherous night out: The specifics are blurry, the headache is blinding, and everybody has a different take on what happened. One lucid fact pierces through the hangover: Germs were a mess of contradictions. Doomed frontman Darby Crash was a well-read savant and a mumbling cretin, crowds adored and abhorred them, and the music they made in four belligerent years reached decades beyond their downfall. By the time their sole studio album (GI) arrived in 1979, Germs had swaggered their way to local infamy, and Crash had crowned himself the genius king of Hollywood’s juvenile delinquents. He died by suicide a little more than a year later at 22. The first LP ever released by Slash Records, (GI) captured Germs in top form. It documents four hardworking iconoclasts who somehow translated their chaotic live sets into a classic record.Before punk-rock brevity came into vogue, Germs opted for glam flamboyance: After forming in 1977, their working name was Sophistifuck and the Revlon Spam Queens. Crash (then known as Bobby Pyn) started the group with friend and classmate Pat Smear. Crash and Smear both attended IPS—an alternative education program within L.A.’s University High School that imparted principles of EST and Scientology. It was there that Crash first dabbled in amateur mind control. “[Darby] had this natural power,” Crash’s friend and schoolmate Paul Roessler recalled in the Germs oral history Lexicon Devil. “It was either that he was so much smarter than anybody else… or he had techniques that he learned from the books he read or from IPS. Or he just had magic.”It was this “magic” that somehow had Germs on everyone’s lips before their first gig at the Orpheum in ’77. Their live debut, opening for the Weirdos, included very little music. “Germs were absolutely fucking terrible!” recalled Weirdos drummer Nickey Beat. “They came on stage, tuned up for 10 or 15 minutes, and then got through maybe one-third of their first song and stopped and started over again… [Darby] took the mic and stuck it in a jar of peanut butter… The Germs weren’t to be taken seriously after that night… for a while.”What Germs lacked in serious prospects they made up for in absurdity. They taunted interviewers like bratty siblings, destroyed property, and got their first single, “Forming,” on the radio by calling KROQ DJ Rodney Bingenheimer multiple times a day until he relented. The band’s fuck-it-all approach seemed both carefree and calculated: long before merch bundles and lengthy album rollouts, Germs had T-shirts, a logo, and a loyal mob of fans, known as Circle One, before they ever laid down a record. Circle One members, typically women, identified themselves by wearing the band’s blue circle insignia, or with grisly “Germs Burns,” which were administered by searing the inner wrist with a lit cigarette from tip to filter. Once healed, a tidy, circular scar formed. “I completely control a number of people’s lives,” Crash once said. “Look around for the little girls wearing CRASH-TRASH T-shirts.” By late ’77, Germs were headlining Brendan Mullen’s notorious nightclub the Masque; punks queued out the door to watch Crash smash beer bottles and bleed on stage.Despite early lineup shuffles—their original drummer was future Go-Go Belinda Carlisle, who came down with mono and enlisted a friend to replace her before the band’s first gig—Germs’ circle wasn’t complete until percussionist Don Bolles joined Crash, guitarist Smear, and bassist Lorna Doom. Similarly, the boy born Jan Paul Beahm did not seal his fate until he rechristened himself Darby Crash. “Whereas Bobby Pyn seemed to me a much more innocent, goofy, carefree character,” Brendan Mullen wrote, “Darby Crash became much more demonic, complex, intense, intoxicated, as he gradually began to exude a much darker persona.”Prior to (GI) (short for “Germs Incognito”), the group had released only a couple of singles. Pronounced the “world’s most volatile band” by writer Kickboy Face, and the “worst band ever” by themselves, it seemed unlikely that any label would sign them. But Slash Records founder Bob Biggs was up to the task. He presented a contract, enlisted Joan Jett to produce, and fronted the cash for Quad Tech studios. Biggs later described his role in (GI) as more “glorified babysitter” than label maven.Something about their impending debut rearranged Germs’ molecular structure. Despite their prior shenanigans, Crash, Smear, Doom, and Bolles got their asses in gear. “My fondest memories of the Germs are right after the beginning and up to recording (GI)... which was a thrilling experience for me,” Doom said. The band rehearsed more than ever, putting in four hours a day, multiple times a week. Their work ethic in the studio was undisputed, although the same cannot be said for Jett, who was frequently passed out, according to many accounts (Crash even makes a crack about it in closing track “Shut Down”).Jett wasn’t the group’s first choice of producer—Crash had his heart set on Mark Lindsay of Paul Revere and the Raiders, but he was too expensive. Jett, who insists she only slept on the job one time, was chosen for her talent, proximity, and friendship with the band. Asleep or not, she managed to channel their focus. “Darby took it pretty seriously,” she said. “We didn’t have to do a lot of takes. He was certainly not out of control in the studio. He respected me. Did what I asked him to do… It was controlled nuttiness at that point.”(GI) was yet another page in Germs’ tome of contradictions. Suddenly, the peanut butter-smeared, tantrum-prone little freaks had (nearly) sobered up and delivered one of the most influential records in punk history. Darby Crash’s progression from blathering imbecile to secret rock’n’roll poet shocked everyone. X’s John Doe was particularly surprised by Crash’s vernacular: “You didn’t know the words because it was all like ‘Warrrrrrrrwarrrwarr,’ when Darby’d sing them live,” he said. “So everyone was just astounded when they got that first Slash record and actually read the lyrics. They were great!”(GI) is often considered the first-ever hardcore album. Bolles’ drumming style was fast and savage, doubling the BPMs of anything the Sex Pistols or Television had released. Meanwhile, Crash’s vocals were far removed from X’s harmonies and Joey Ramone’s chewed-up bubblegum. Crash didn’t sing: he growled. On (GI) centerpiece “Manimal,” he assumes the pelt of a rabid feline: “I came into this world like a puzzled panther/Waiting to be caged… I was never quite tamed,” he snarls. “Manimal” contains some of Crash’s most succinct and effective writing. It has none of the stilted, two-dollar words that sometimes appeared in Germs’ catalog (even Smear admitted that Crash’s lyrics could be “a bit pretentious”), and the song marries thematic and sonic elements better than most of their tracks. It is also one of many cuts on (GI) to hint at Crash’s impending death. “Evolution is a process/Too slow to save my soul,” he sneers, before letting out a pained roar like a wildcat being dragged off by poachers.Like many bands, Germs’ ingenuity grew from limitations. When they formed, no one could really play an instrument, save for Smear, who dabbled in guitar throughout high school. As they performed and rehearsed, they realized they could play better and faster. Bolles perfected his machine-gun drumming, Doom fine-tuned her trademark “wall-of-whump” basslines, and Smear developed a guitar style that was shrill, gritty, and metallic—it often sounded like he was scraping his strings with a cheese grater. Their playing on (GI) is a balancing act of personality and restraint, leaving space for Crash to run the show.Crash was a born prophet, a “premeditated would-be apocalyptic cult leader,” as friend and producer Geza X put it in another oral history, We Got the Neutron Bomb. Darby’s followers were already chauffeuring him around L.A. and footing his endless bar tab long before (GI) arrived. “When you have people for friends and they’re not the kind of people you want, what do you do?” he once asked an interviewer. “You make some better ones.” On (GI), Crash’s frightening magnetism was spelled out in song, and “We Must Bleed” is the most stirring distillation of his power. Crash repeats the titular line with such conviction, he sounds like a deranged preacher distributing the poisoned applesauce to his disciples.Crash was intrigued by the charisma of cult leaders and dictators, from Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard to Charles Manson, Hitler, and Mussolini. “Richie Dagger’s Crime” portrayed a more benevolent side of Darby’s coercive nature. The song’s narrator is a holdover from Crash’s glam roots—a swaggering “boy that nobody owns.” Dagger was a dead ringer for Crash, who grew from “a child despised” into a teenage messiah. When he sings, “I can take on your heroes” it’s both a threat and a premonition—and the closest Germs ever came to pop music. “Lexicon Devil,” perhaps (GI)’s most iconic entry, repurposes Crash’s favorite manipulation device, suffered by everyone he knew: “Gimme, gimme this, gimme, gimme thaaaaaaat.” The song was an admission of Crash’s thirst for supremacy, confirming that nothing he did was by accident.If any of (GI)’s songs were out of step with Germs’ repertoire, it was “Shut Down,” a nine-minute, narcotized jam session. Smear, Doom, and Bolles made minor detours from one circular riff, while Crash improvised lyrics that volleyed between playful and disturbing. One minute, he mocked Belinda Carlisle for being a cheerleader. Measures later, he nodded to the needle: “When I put that in my arm, I know that it done no harm.”(GI) came out at a time when Led Zeppelin, Supertramp, and the Eagles were topping the Billboard 200. It didn’t get anywhere near the charts, but local critics took note. In his Los Angeles Times column, Richard Meltzer crowned (GI) album of the year, calling it “the most remarkable L.A. studio achievement at least since L.A. Woman.” At last, there was documentation that Germs were a legitimate band who could write and cut a record, and a great record at that. It was their best work—the gold standard they never got the chance to improve upon.In the following year, Darby Crash rapidly eroded due to substance abuse. Filmmaker Penelope Spheeris’ punk documentary The Decline of Western Civilization captured his incoherence, making previous claims of his “genius” seem ridiculous. As Crash’s drug use escalated in his final months, so did his sense of alienation. Germs broke up, Crash made a failed attempt at going solo, and he became increasingly distraught over his closeted sexuality—many of Crash’s friends didn’t learn he was gay until after he died. On December 3, Germs played a reunion show. Everyone agreed it was the band’s best performance ever. Don Bolles was so happy playing the concert, he was convinced Germs would regroup for good. But Crash had other plans. “The only reason I’m doing this is to get money to get enough heroin to kill myself with,” he told Smear before the gig. Crash had threatened suicide so many times that few people took him seriously. Four nights later, Crash and friend Casey Cola procured $400 worth of heroin, drove to Cola’s mother’s house, and shot up. Somehow, Cola survived. When she came to the next day, Crash was lying dead next to her.In a cruel twist of fate, Darby Crash died a day before John Lennon, and the news of his passing was largely overshadowed by the Beatle’s murder. It took years for Crash to be widely recognized as a gifted writer, but his work took on a new life after his ended. Germs had an immediate impact on their L.A. peers, but their contributions were particularly felt in the following decades, when artists like Hole, L7, Melvins, Henry Rollins, Meat Puppets, and Red Hot Chili Peppers cited the band as a major influence. After a string of odd jobs and musical exploits, Smear joined Nirvana as a second guitarist in 1993. As a touring member for their In Utero trek, Smear played on the band’s famed MTV Unplugged session in 1994. Following Kurt Cobain’s death, Smear became a founding member of Foo Fighters. He still plays with them today.Bolles continues to perform with a handful of bands, and works as a radio DJ. Doom, who passed away earlier this year, retreated from the music scene after Crash died, remerging briefly in the early 2000s to play a few reunion gigs with Smear, Bolles, and actor Shane West filling in on vocals. West starred as Crash in the 2007 Germs biopic What We Do Is Secret, a heap of schmaltz that is hard to watch, but confirms the ill-fated frontman’s eternal allure. Darby Crash knew that Germs’ music was the first step in establishing his legacy. “Records are only a medium to get something else done,” he once said. “I want to die when I’m done.” (GI) serves as the final testament from one of punk’s most divisive figures—a man who was sadistic and kind, brilliant and obtuse, and destined to eclipse his inner circle.",2019-10-27,9.0
Jonathan Fire*Eater,Tremble Under Boom Lights,,"Jonathan Fire*Eater’s Walter Martin once interrupted a meeting with Dreamworks label brass to see about capping sales of Wolf Songs for Lambs, their major label debut, at an even half-million, lest the band grew too big, too quickly. Ambitious, but perhaps a bit premature; Wolf Songs wound up selling about 10,000 copies in the early going, a few zeros shy of the Appetite for Destruction numbers Martin was gunning for. Chutzpah isn’t everything, but it’s certainly not nothing, and what DC-to-NYC before-their-timers Jonathan Fire*Eater lacked in bankable success, they more than made up with unshakable faith in their own abilities. Through their brief, tumultuous tenure, the elegantly wasted JFE looked, acted, and frequently even sounded like heirs apparent to the big crown. They never really came close.Yet, while traditional markers of fame and fortune may’ve eluded them, Jonathan Fire*Eater’s influence on a generation of stall-hogging, scene-making New York rockers—some of whom did go on to the kind world-conquering fame JFE only grasped at—is incalculable. Flip through the first few chapters of Lizzy Goodman’s NYC scene tell-all Meet Me in the Bathroom, and you’ll see one bold-face name after another singing JFE’s praises, if not openly copping to stealing their moves. Jonathan*Fire Eater were it; and then, just as suddenly, they weren’t.For years now, Jonathan Fire*Eater have been a band more talked about than actually listened to. That’s largely been a problem of access: For nearly 20 years, just about the only record available through the usual channels was the spiny Wolf Songs for Lambs, which served as many curious Karen O fans’ first and only taste of JFE. And Wolf Songs is a stellar record, all subterranean scrum atop squealing organs and clattering drums. Now, Third Man has brought Tremble Under Boom Lights—the band’s 1996 mini-LP, released a year before Wolf Songs—back to shelves, alongside five bonus cuts and a chapbook of Stewart Lupton’s poetry. It’s not quite Marvin Berry holding the receiver up to Marty McFly, but two decades on, Tremble Under Boom Lights does manage to sound like a hiccup in the timeline: The brash young JFE didn’t just arrive in NYC fully formed, they showed up to the party five years early.The short version of Jonathan Fire*Eater’s turgid tale goes something like this: DC boys, prep schoolers all, forge a proto-JFE called the Ignobles. The Ignobles eventually relocate to NYC, recruit bassist Tom Frank, put Stewart Lupton behind the mic, and acquire the asterisk. From there, they hustled: Meet Me in the Bathroom finds Lupton glad-handing at every gallery opening and 4 a.m. bar he could find, shamelessly trying to get the word out. Even early on, JFE had something: They were preppy with an unlikely goth edge, “talky” without digressing into polemic, wide-ranging in their musical interests but still very much rooted in oily, scuzzy rock’n’roll. Once they’d worked through the collective throat-clearing of their self-titled debut, their sound was fully in place: big blasts of Walter Martin’s dusty organ, Matt Barrick’s galvanic drumwork, Frank’s subcutaneous bass, Paul Maroon’s alternately stately and spooky guitar, and the scrawled-past-the-margins picaresques of the late Stewart Lupton.Lupton was possessed with the kind of preternatural confidence granted to only the heavily deluded and the genuinely dazzling, and after three seconds with Tremble Under Boom Lights, it’s pretty clear he wasn’t kidding himself. He’s a man of 1,000 voices, able to jut nimbly through a dry Iggy Pop drawl, a squawking Timmy Taylor falsetto, and the Jarvis-worthy swoon that closes out “Winston Plum: Undertaker.” Mostly, though, he’s a scene-stealer, a scenery chewer: whether prattling on about yet another estranged relative or passing out in the hotel hallway after too much free record company hooch, Lupton’s never less than compelling, stuffing scene after roundabout scene with past regrets and unsteady futures.Rollicking highlight “Give Me Daughters” imagines Lupton, years down the road, ringing up his theoretical offspring from some dingy motel. The song is more or less a tacit admission that Lupton’s not about to settle down anytime soon, and like many of his songs, it finds him sliding further and further into a kind of perpetual transience: always on the go, always looking for a new rush, always wondering what his life might’ve been had he hewed a little closer to the straight and narrow. Lupton’s prone to abstraction and red herrings, stocking the pond with characters whose purpose remains somewhat unclear. This Dylanesque combination of cracked imagery cut with bohemian drift is the jewel in Lupton’s crown, the dividing line between JFE and so many other citified mopesters, past and present. “It’s important that you know how I want all the shadows on my street to converge every time it snows and have the conversation that they really need,” he sings on the gnashing “Make It Precious,” the kind of line—and there are plenty like it here—you could spend a lifetime turning over in your head.The tension between the wild-eyed, increasingly unpredictable Lupton and his more temperate bandmates was JFE’s ultimate undoing, but Tremble finds the two sides sparking each other to new heights. Tom Frank—along with Lupton, JFE’s only non-Walkman—brings an almost visceral heft to the low end with his near-toneless bass. Matt Barrick’s drumwork is, as with the Walkmen, the electricity in the socket: without him, the whole thing never gets off the ground. On the organ, Walter Martin favors a piercing, otherworldly sound that’s more “96 Tears” than the grandiose Rothko techtonics he favored later. They wield this rangy, malleable sound—an ever-shifting mishmash of moddish classic rock and post-punk, speckled with Motown and new romance—with all the foolish audacity of youth. These guys just went for it, and 20 years past its sell-by date, their cocktail of inexperience and gall hasn’t lost a drop of potency.The five songs from the initial Tremble release are joined here by five additional tunes: three from 1995’s Public Hanging of a Movie Star EP, a pants-free cover of Lee Hazlewood’s “The City Never Sleeps,” and the previously unheard “In the Head.” The spry, mercurial Tremble songs, available for the first time this century, are the real draw here, but the Public Hanging songs—JFE’s first release after their forgettable debut—are where the band sorted out the sonics, pushed the vocals to the front, and came into their own. “In the Head” is thought to be their final recording, finished not long before their 1998 split; it’s tempting to hear the first murmurs of the Walkmen in its “In the New Year” ripple, but the tune belongs, as they all do, to Lupton: Adopting a decidedly Dylanesque wheeze, he inches the ambling track heavenward. By the end, organs are churning, Lupton’s howling, and the whole thing seems to collapse in on itself. Lupton seems right at home.Influence is a strange currency: It seems valuable enough, but the exchange rate’s lousy. Jonathan Fire*Eater were, for a moment, the hottest band in New York, which was just enough to earn them a massively lopsided deal with Dreamworks and the occasional Paul Banks namecheck. Their stormy, searching sound still looms large over the glammy inversions of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, the brackish urgency of Interpol, and so many others, but for too long, that’s how most people encountered their music: indirectly. Once JFE split, Lupton disappeared for a couple years, reemerging as the Childballads and, later, the Beatin’s; Martin, Barrick, and Maroon’s Walkmen called it quits in late 2013, and Frank took a gig with Vanity Fair. Lupton passed away in 2018, a tragically early end. There’ll always be a lot of “what if?” hanging over JFE, particularly now, with no chance of a full reunion. But for all their accidents of fate, Jonathan*Fire Eater accomplished something most bands can only dream of: not many may remember, but those who do won’t soon forget.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-26,8.0
Jimmy Eat World,Surviving,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","Surviving is apt. Formed in 1993, and featuring the same core members since ’95, Jimmy Eat World has enjoyed a course marked by steady output, frequent touring and quiet durability. As luck would have it, they’ve hung on long enough to find themselves releasing their 10th studio album just as emo nostalgia reaches its zenith. Surviving is both occasion for a survey of the beloved Arizona band’s two-decade-plus career and a further push into arena rock; a driving, if not always transportative, selection that should tour favorably.Their latest reunites them with Justin Meldal-Johnsen, the producer for M83 and decades-long live bassist for Beck who worked on their triumphant last album, 2016’s Integrity Blues. On Surviving, the producer guides the band’s instincts towards a heavier sound, letting noise from their guitars and Zach Lind’s drums decay. Meldal-Johnsen addresses lacunae in frontman Jim Adkins’ operative knowledge of synth sounds, as on the U2-evocative “555,” an album outlier which features some Fitz and the Tantrums-like hand-clapping. James King, co-founding member of Fitz, shows up for a saxophone solo on “All The Way (Stay),” just like he did on the Meldal-Johnsen-produced M83 sparkler “Midnight City.” Longtime collaborator and former touring member Rachel Haden, of that dog., contributes backing vocals. The track, which considers staying away from the party rather than at it (“Who really says they hope they’ll meet ‘the one’ for the first time at a bar drinking early?”) is one of the more personal allusions to recovery from addiction that Adkins, sober for six years, ventures here.Lyrically, Surviving is as sincere as their past efforts but less specific. “You’re not alone in pain/Never alone in pain,” Adkins sings on the album’s title track. The band’s shortest LP to date, Surviving moves at a quick clip, losing some of the polish from their last outing with Meldal-Johnsen. They’re conscious when they sound too slick for their own good: The opening acoustic guitar riff on “One Mil” was recorded on Adkins’ iPhone mic in his garage. AFI frontman Davey Havok, who appears on the album finale “Congratulations,” also appears via iPhone.“There’s no clarity in front of me,” Adkins sings on that song, which serves as a sort of curtain call. At six minutes, it somehow still feels a little short. It’s hard to imagine this iteration of J.E.W. recording another “Goodbye Sky Harbor,” that loitering Clarity closer that would take up nearly half of their latest album’s length. By Surviving’s terminus, listeners might find themselves wanting more risks. But the album on the whole is a solid, self-aware addition to Jimmy Eat World’s catalog, and if the band’s modest strivers’ outlook has proved anything, it’s that there will be another. A band whose biggest song is against writing oneself off always has work to do.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-26,6.9
Eartheater,Trinity,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=experimental"">Experimental</a>","Alexandra Drewchin titled the fourth full-length release under her Eartheater alias as a nod to the three states matter can commonly take: solid, liquid, and gas. It’s a fitting conceit to drape over her work, which tends to melt from concrete pop forms into ominous miasma and back again. Trinity, a mixtape made in collaboration with half a dozen New York producers including AceMo and Tony Seltzer, crystallizes Drewchin’s experimental slant into a full set of dance music built around her signature oblique vocals. Without sacrificing Eartheater’s compelling strangeness, Drewchin has assembled the project’s most accessible and triumphant offering to date.Dance beats skittered here and there on past Eartheater records, but more often than not they worked as texturing tools against the rest of Drewchin’s nebulous compositions. On “Curtains,” from 2018’s IRISIRI, a rave beat pulsed against sheets of placid harp, as though leaking into an orchestral musician’s practice session from an upstairs apartment. Trinity hews closer to the traditional dynamics of dance music: Its songs take beats for their backbones, even if those beats often lurch uneasily through dizzying arrangements. For every element on Trinity that’s easy to grasp, another repels and confuses the ear. On “High Tide” and “Supersoaker,” glassy synthesizer riffs echo late-’90s radio trance, while the blunt bass drums on “Pearl Diver” recall avant-garde strains of contemporary hip-hop.Throughout the record, Drewchin’s voice closes off the easy access points of dance pop, which in its most mainstream incarnations tends to flood listeners with dopamine at every chorus. Layered and thinned with reverb, her singing remains slippery, her lyrics often tricky to pin down. Ostensibly these are love songs, and yet their streaks of affection drip out in confusing, contradictory ways, in double negatives and barely intelligible whispers. “I don’t wanna regret/Something I didn’t do/With you,” Drewchin sings on “Runoff”—a statement that starts out with what sounds like hesitation, which turns into abandon by the end of the sentence.Because her presence is often elusive, it tends to beckon the ear to sink deeper into each song, to grasp at a salient phrase or an especially tuneful melody. Drewchin makes it easy to get lost in her ambiguous sound worlds, which don’t seem to have clear boundaries but always appear to be deepening in volume.Trinity’s tensions build toward its final song and thesis statement, “Solid Liquid Gas.” Rather than end the record on an uncertain, sour note, Drewchin and producer Hara Kiri give it the sendoff it deserves—an unleashed, cathartic dance track where Drewchin’s voice clears away the mist that had clung to it. “Don’t make me wait!” she demands, her voice dense and sharp over a frothing synthesizer arpeggio. If latent desire percolates throughout Trinity, voiced in hushed tones, then “Solid Liquid Gas” gives Drewchin the chance to finally let her wanting rush out of her. It’s a blissful release that bursts past the cerebral parameters of her prior work and into new territory—the kind of song that jolts through the whole body, thrilling as it goes.",2019-10-26,7.3
Rex Orange County,Pony,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=pop"">Pop/R&amp;B</a>","Alex O’Connor self-released bcos u will never b free, his first modest bedroom project as Rex Orange County, in 2015. It’s not hard to hear the appeal of that first tape: The songs were imperfect and angsty, with an amateur production style that fit Rex’s creaky nasal voice. “Pizza box/Wedding ring left amongst the crust,” he drawled, sketching a banal, absurd image of a crumbling relationship. “Don’t miss me when I’m dead,” he pleaded, and then followed up with an earnest rap verse about rejecting peer pressure.His sound also appealed to Tyler, the Creator, who recruited the English singer and songwriter for his 2017 album Flower Boy. It became Rex’s breakout moment. After meeting Tyler, he rushed out another album, Apricot Princess, so that people who learned about him from Flower Boy would have something to listen to. This week, he released Pony, his first album for Sony and the third entry in Rex’s slim, sentimental catalog.Rex’s distinctive voice has earned him the epithet “old soul,” but his newest music is relentlessly juvenile. When he landed a Spotify deal that offered the opportunity to work with an established artist on a cover song, he picked Randy Newman and “You’ve Got a Friend in Me.” On Pony, a collection of 10 new songs irritating enough to activate the mildest allergy to sincerity, he sings about being young and in love; about getting a little older but not yet old enough; about feeling like a comic-book superhero and getting “Stressed Out.” “When we have to speak I usually shoe gaze,” he admits on “Laser Lights,” with a delivery style equally indebted to Chance the Rapper’s singing and Ed Sheeran’s rapping.Pony employs a more childlike musical palette than Rex’s earlier projects—bubbly synths, electric piano, programmed beats, bells, strings, and bird chirps—and though there’s still a waxy haze surrounding them, the intensity is dialed up. There’s always something jumping out of the mix to compete for attention—sometimes a pop of cartoonish horns, but more often Rex’s quavery voice, a limiting factor Pony tries every possible way to work around: chipmunk squeaks (“Stressed Out”), Vocoder (“Never Had the Balls”), digital barbershop quartet (“Face to Face”), distant-sounding piped-in vocals set to strings (“Pluto Projector”) or a disco beat (“It Gets Better”). The lyrics to “Never Had the Balls” feel extra crude because the setting is so immature; the treacly piano love song “Every Way” would be more believable from Mr. Rogers.None of this straining supports an interesting idea. “Four years later/Look where we really are/Look how far we’ve come,” Rex sings on “It Gets Better,” over tinny, melodramatic electric strings. He’s not talking about graduating, or growing up in general—he’s talking about a girl who’s transformed his world in ways apparently not worth itemizing. You won’t find a wedding ring in a pizza box here. The album’s most salient detail is when Rex recalls a particular house where he once vomited.Pony’s best line comes at the opening of “Pluto Projector,” a slow, Frank Ocean-esque ballad. “The great protector/Is that what I’m supposed to be?” Rex asks. “What if all this counts for nothin’/Everything I thought I’d be?/What if by the time I realize/It’s too far behind to see?” Toward the end, the song takes a weird turn: a pitched-down vocal coda that makes Rex sound like he’s drop-shipping counterfeit “Nikes.”But Rex Orange County isn’t Frank Ocean; he stacks vast emotional weight on predictable, inoffensive songs until they buckle like wire shelving. Pony is simplistic, clueless, subtlety-free. “Didn’t understand until the age of 18/Even then I was blind,” he sings on “It Gets Better.” Over and over again, Rex sounds like he hasn’t begun to realize how much he doesn’t know.",2019-10-25,5.0
Sufjan Stevens,The Decalogue,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=folk"">Folk/Country</a>","It’s hard to believe, but over the last 10 years, Sufjan Stevens has soundtracked twice as many ballets as he’s recorded solo albums. He and choreographer Justin Peck began working together in 2012, when the rising dance star asked Stevens to rework selections from his experimental electronic album Enjoy Your Rabbit for the New York City Ballet. Stevens balked at first, but after George Balanchine’s Stravinsky-scored classics (namely Agon) opened his ears to the expressive possibilities of the form, the singer-songwriter relented, which led to the blossoming of a meaningful creative relationship with Peck.Stevens’ initial hesitation around entering the world of ballet stemmed not only from his qualms with Enjoy Your Rabbit—he downplayed it as “a ramshackle little personal hobby project”—but also his perceptions of ballet itself. “Ballet seemed so anachronistic, so formal and classical and archaic and irrelevant to pop culture,” he said in 2014. Everywhere We Go, the first collaboration with Peck to feature all new, original music, was defined by its intricate arrangements and emphasis on melody, a pointed repudiation of that perceived stuffiness. By contrast, The Decalogue—a borderline academic suite for solo piano, inspired by the Ten Commandments—suggests a self-conscious attempt to compose according to a notion of what contemporary ballet music should sound like. The result is a knotty but welcome entry to Stevens’ discography, albeit one that feels like the result of the artist immersing himself in Peck’s influences rather than the other way round.This new studio recording of The Decalogue, which arrives two years after the debut of Peck’s ballet, does not actually feature Stevens in a performing role. The composer instead opts to have the pianist and contemporary classical composer Timo Andres interpret the score. In Andres’ skilled hands, the pieces move and breathe dynamically, and it’s easy to imagine a cadre of dancers performing pirouettes to the constantly modulating chords. Still, as a standalone piece of music, Decalogue may come across as unusually atonal for any Sufjan fans expecting familiar motifs from their favorite baroque pop polymath, who culled from approximately 50 “impromptu improvisations” to assemble the score.With some exceptions, Decalogue’s piano passages wash over the listener and disappear almost as soon as they materialize. That isn’t to say there are no affecting scenes: The ascendant arpeggios at the beginning of “V” provide an immediately arresting structure for the rest of the piece to flow into. Andres’ execution of the skittering downward runs at the end of “VIII” prove a breathtaking display of musicianship, and the thunderous grand finale in “X” is stirring, if a bit rote. But the album never reveals any whole greater than the sum of its parts, and those parts suffer from a lack of focus.Stevens has said he wanted The Decalogue to be “more pensive and more cerebral, and less explicitly harmonic and melodic” than Everywhere We Go, and he certainly achieves his goal. He’s since moved on from such exercises, describing his most recent work with Peck, Principia, as a middle ground between those prior scores. That new ballet just so happens to feature orchestrations by Andres, a link that implies the pianist isn’t merely a gifted hired gun. Their collaborations may bear more fruit in the years to come, but ultimately The Decalogue is a Stevens curio like Enjoy Your Rabbit and The BQE before it: riveting to diehards, an agreeable footnote for anyone else.--Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-25,6.5
Hana Vu,Nicole Kidman / Anne Hathaway,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=pop"">Pop/R&amp;B</a>","Hana Vu wrote the songs for her dual EP, Nicole Kidman/Anne Hathaway by watching episodes of The Hollywood Reporter’s “The Actress Roundtable” and then conjuring backstories for the women on screen. For Vu, the project’s premise is an entry point for her to do what she does best: crystalize a wisp of an emotion, until the sentiment feels so tactile it could break.Vu’s first EP, the perfectly titled Crying on the Subway, was rooted in bedroom pop, but these EPs explore other genres. She layers and reverbs her vocals on  “Worm” until they sound like a hymn, while “Order” descends into full-on, guitar-thrashing rock. Each track feels like a contained performance, and the lyrics consider the nuanced ways in which acting is tucked into our everyday lives.These aren’t necessarily love songs, and it’s hard to map a narrative onto any track in particular. She wishes someone would cry about her. She croons about “disguises.” “Outside,” which could be a Paramore or Lorde track, comes the closest to feeling personal: “If I look at my phone all day, does it really help my chances?” she asks, waiting for a text that never comes.Vu produced the record herself, and the muted, minimalist fizz matches the distant monotone of her voice. Each track builds around a wrenching line that dissolves into the soundscape. “I’ll never be good enough,” ends the first song, “At the Party,” as a synth sputters and fades. “I wanna be a hero/I want to save you, I wanna save me,” she sings on “Fighter,” with all traces of actual desire drained from her voice.No track on the compact, 10-song project feels unnecessary, but most blend into each other without sounding distinct. (The glaring exception is her cover of “Reflection,” from the Disney movie Mulan, which is thematically relevant but still seems out of place.) That’s not the worst quality in an album that is equally sparse and lush, simple and shimmering, but it shows a space Vu can grow into.",2019-10-25,7.2
Tribe,Hometown: Detroit Sessions 1990​-​2014,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=jazz"">Jazz</a>","Almost from its birth, Tribe was much more than simply a jazz group. It was a living example of the ways that community and cultural capital could evolve together during the American century’s final third, in a city that helped define the era’s musical and civic spirit: Detroit, Michigan. Tribe began as a collective around four musicians—reed player Wendell Harrison, trombonist Phil Ranellin, trumpeter Marcus Belgrave, and pianist Harold McKinney—who embodied the late 1960s’ spirit of black self-determination. It ended up a local institution, tutoring program, and one of the unmistakable through lines in the city’s musical history. The contributions of Tribe members stretch directly from Ray Charles and Motown to Geri Allen and Detroit techno. If Hometown: Detroit Sessions 1990-2014, a wonderful compilation of mostly unreleased recordings from the latter chapters of Tribe’s history, doesn’t quite scale early-career musical heights, it makes clear that judging lifelong endeavors through a narrow lens of a single period of time—even one that contemporary perspective deems “classic”—is a fool’s errand.There is no denying the value of Tribe’s revolutionary early sounds. Recorded mostly under the names of individual players and only occasionally as a group, their fluid mixture of soulful post-bop swing, free avant-garde playing, hard in-the-pocket jazz-funk, and almighty music of the spirit continues to spill gracefully off comps like Soul Jazz’s Message From the Tribe: An Anthology of Tribe Records 1972-76 or P-Vine’s Vibes From the Tribe Vol. I and Vol. II; it’s likely to appeal to any admirer of improvisational rapture or a fat-ass groove. But the myriad activities around these recordings, the ones that helped build and sustain both Detroit’s mythical creative streak and its literal artistic community, expose Tribe’s deeper virtues.This is where neighborhood capital, and Tribe’s contribution to it, come into play. The self-sustaining ethos of Tribe Records, Harrison’s Wenha Records, and Harrison and McKiney’s Rebirth Records helped carry on Motown’s ideal of homegrown, artist-run labels, one that continues in the city’s dance music to this day. Tribe magazine—published from 1972 until 1977 and edited by journalist Herb Boyd, author of Hometown’s liner notes and the great 2017 book Black Detroit: A People's History of Self-Determination—was deeply involved in local politics, galvanizing votes for  the city’s first black mayor, Coleman Young. (According to Mark Stryker’s fine new book Jazz From Detroit, the publication was also successful enough to fund Tribe Records.) And both Marcus Belgrave’s Jazz Development Workshop and Harrison and McKinney’s educational and event-production organization Rebirth Inc. were responsible for fine-tuning an endless list of Detroit’s musical talent.That’s one reason Hometown is stocked with performers you may recognize from classic John Coltrane albums (bassist Reggie Workman) or Theo Parrish 12""s (trumpeter John Douglas), along with lesser-known giants (trumpeter Jimmy Owens, trombonist Kiani Zawadi). Despite consisting of three separate sessions recorded over 24 years, and featuring two dozen players, the collection feels like a unified work. Eschewing the outer territories Tribe members once wandered, Hometown conveys a more comforting musical tradition (though with plenty of details that trail outward like breadcrumbs, for those paying attention). Its sound is, to quote the title of the McKinney piece that opens the set, “Wide and Blue.” Recorded live in 1995, at the SereNgeti Ballroom, a great turn-of-the-century Detroit jazz space, the song cuts a relaxed and confident stride: McKinney and Workman’s extended conversation and Harrison’s compact tenor solo are bookended by a theme stated on four horns—Harrison, Belgrave, Owens, and Zawadi. It’s a harmonic statement that wouldn’t seem out of place in the classic Blue Note songbook—that is, until the diminuendo, when horns unlock into a frenzied blowing burst that’s part Frenchmen Street, part Saturn.Hometown collects many such knowing touches as it showcases the depth of an oft-ignored creative community and its cultural staying power. The experience and mastry is there for all to hear, whether in the lesser-known compositions (each of the 10 songs is an original that features its author) or in exceptional playing, which is beguilingly concise.The songs are alone worth the price. Ranelin’s “Freddie’s Groove” is a dance number honoring Freddie Hubbard, precisely capturing the legendary trumpeter’s funky Red Clay/Straight Life period (cue: Ralphe Armstrong’s uncut bassline, Harrison quoting cartoon themes like Sonny Rollins, and guitarist John Arnold in rocked-up George Benson mode). The Pamela Wise composition that gives the compilation its name beautifully mixes the propulsion of a squad of percussionists with the intertwined melancholy of Douglas’ trumpet and Harrison’s tenor, supported by Wise’s modal keys. Zawadi’s “Libra Ahora,” the set’s single moment of stretching out, brings the clave and the drummers (including a star turn by percussionist Frencesco Mora), plus an extended interplay between the four horns. And then there’s McKinney’s “Juba,” which opens with the pianist’s wife and twin daughters in a rendition of an antebellum handclap-and-voice holler, followed by a horn party that McKinney amends by banging out wonderfully dissonant clusters.Such social history has always been central to Tribe’s musical expression, and Hometown features a trio of direct lyrical engagements with the past that also speak to the present. Wise’s “Ode to Black Mothers” and “Marcus Garvey,” featuring words by poet/pastor Mbiyu Chui, are familiar ceremonial acclamations in which a lone teacher rises on a bed of drums to bear a valuable lesson. But McKinney’s closing “Slave Ship Enterprise” is something else entirely: a two-decades-old, solo piano-and-voice reading whose prescience would be remarkable if you didn’t know that black America has been preaching its message for a century. It is an inversion of the chords of “America the Beautiful,” rewritten as an operatically delivered tone poem, with McKinney unfurling a broad “comment on the American phenomenon”—at times ambient, at others direct. “Seems so near and dear, yet so far/Near as our ideals, yet far from the way we are,” reads his indictment of the “land of the free,” a ship “of state… where captain and captive must share a common fate.”The fact that “Slave Ship Enterprise” ends on an almost undeserved image of hope—“U.S. spells ‘us’”—says a lot about where the faith of both Tribe and McKinney, who passed away in 2001, lay. (Belgrave died in 2015.) Like much of the collective’s work, musical and otherwise, it was rooted in the strength of the community and its culture. There was (and remains) an inherent understanding that the vitality of any hometown is expressed not only in how brightly its light shines, but in how long the people keep it on.",2019-10-25,7.7
Gucci Mane,Woptober II,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rap"">Rap</a>","Since re-emerging transformed from prison as a chiseled, healthy-living Adonis, Gucci Mane’s major projects have included an extra layer of gloss and a few unlikely commercial compromises. In the last year he’s teamed up with Bruno Mars and Justin Bieber on songs that boxed Gucci into a pillow-soft style that predictably didn’t showcase his strengths. It’s easy to envision the conference call with label executives that led to these cuts: “You present like a star now, Gucci. It’s time to get out in front with those radio singles.”But these cuddly aberrations aside, Gucci has largely stayed loyal to his established sound. Woptober II is no more a natural sequel to the original 2016 mixtape than any other Gucci project; the title probably just means it happened to drop this month. Like most of his recent records, it’s another collection of mostly very good Gucci Mane songs, marred by occasional awkward bits.Though still relentlessly paced (this is his second album of the year, following Delusions of Grandeur), Gucci’s output has come a long way from the low-quality data dumps he delivered while he was away, presumably just to keep new music flowing. His trademark swollen southern drawl has been remodeled as something more precise. On “Time to Move,” he moves effortlessly from a menacing whisper to a spiky flow as he recalls tales of waking up in new Bugatti and lies told on the witness stand.Woptober II’s best moments are when Gucci has company. On “Bucking the System,” his voice is slow and hypnotic before Kevin Gates blows through the track, the yin-and-yang flows accentuating the duo’s chemistry. And on “Richer Than Errybody,” Gucci teams up with rising players YoungBoy Never Broke Again and DaBaby, sounding just as fit and uncompromising as his youthful collaborators.There are silly moments. “Big Booty,” featuring Megan Thee Stallion, summons the spirit of 2 Live Crew. It’s a track that would have fallen flat even five years ago, when Nicki Minaj and Jennifer Lopez were causing a mini-revival in these kind of Miami bass-inspired ass anthems. And sleazy raps aside, it’s fair to say that Gucci regularly underperforms lyrically on Woptober II. The low point comes on “Tootsies,” when he tosses off a poorly considered jab at Kanye West’s mental health issues.As for the beats, Gucci’s go-to team of star producers (London on da Track, Zaytoven, Southside, Da Honorable C.N.O.T.E, and more) mostly serve up archetypal Trap God instrumentals without ever distinguishing themselves. J. White Did It (of “Bodak Yellow” fame) encapsulates the malaise on “Move Me,” which leans on the old Dragnet theme tune like an out-of-shape distance runner sagging against a wall. It’s a reminder that one of Gucci’s stronger recent projects, Droptopwop, benefitted from being overseen by producer Metro Boomin, who tied everything together while keeping the rapper’s worst proclivities in check.",2019-10-24,6.1
Patrick Cowley,Mechanical Fantasy Box,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=electronic"">Electronic</a>","Before his death in 1982, the producer and musician Patrick Cowley was best known for electronic disco productions that defined San Francisco’s gay hi-NRG scene. He was one of the first entertainers with national impact (if not the first) to die of AIDS (his “Menergy” and “Megatron Man” hit the top of Billboard’s club chart in 1981). The party line is that his “career began to rise as his health failed him” (words cribbed from his Bay Area Reporter obit), and the music he made in his final year had a starry slickness to it suggesting even better things to come. The last song he cut with Sylvester, “Do You Wanna Funk?,” would go on to become his most widely known, somewhat ironically, after its inclusion in 1983’s Trading Places. That movie was a vehicle for Eddie Murphy, who told virulently homophobic jokes in his standup at the time; his landmark special Delirious, from the same year, opens with an extended bit about “faggots.” In the ’80s, Murphy was a mainstream icon; Cowley was an all-but-forgotten cult figure. The disparity in the cultural volume of their voices is a small illustration of how gay history worked for decades.Josh Cheon, former member of the queer DJ collective Honey Soundsystem and mastermind behind the reissue label Dark Entries, has worked to flesh out Cowley’s legacy with an archival series of posthumous releases. By now, he has shepherded more releases into the world than were available when Cowley was alive. Cheon’s excavation work has exposed less frenetic, ambient-leaning and weirder sides of Cowley’s music. The three previous solo Cowley releases on Dark Entries largely contained material he composed for gay porn flicks—sleazy synth work whose sheer oddness could easily have been lost on consumers who had, ahem, other things to focus on.The latest compilation, Mechanical Fantasy Box, was released on what would have been Cowley’s 69th birthday. It spans the years 1973 to 1980 and has less of a conceptual framework than earlier collections, offering 12 previously unreleased odds and ends mostly sourced from 10-inch reels of Cowley’s synth work juvenilia. It’s unclear if Cowley ever intended this material for release, and as such, will likely appeal most to fans hungry for more excavation of Cowley’s legacy. While not without its charm, Mechanical Fantasy Box is the last place those unfamiliar with Cowley’s work should go exploring.“His early process was often shooting in the dark and seeing what happened,” wrote early Cowley collaborator Maurice Tani, and there is a sense of playfulness to Mechanical Fantasy Box. An arpeggiated squiggle flirts with the right ear in opener “Out of Body (Intro)” before hard-panning to the left as other synths whistle and clunk like a swimmer hitting his head on a boat underwater. Many of the songs contain one, if not several, high-pitched and twitchy sounds that repeat anxiously, but there’s an overall sense of motion here—these aren’t looped compositions, they’re sound designs that mutate over time as parts fade in and out. The best example of this is “Moving Bodies 1,” which starts out dissonant to the point of seeming hostility before, out of nowhere, it all coheres into an unlikely groove.“Right Here, Right Now” is the Mechanical Fantasy Box cut with the most bodily immediacy, pummeling through its arpeggiated bass line, drums that pop and sizzle, and synths that mimic cosmic phasers. It’s the closest thing to hi-NRG here, though a little too fast and woozy to be a proper dance track. The amusingly titled “Lumberjacks in Heat” has the insistence of a John Carpenter score with the terror-prog energy of Goblin’s Suspiria main theme. It doesn’t sound like sex music to me, but Cowley had a voracious appetite and a vivid imagination; if anyone could make this work in a sexual situation, it was probably him.I get this sense, mind you, after reading the sex journal Cowley kept (at times sporadically) from 1975 to 1980, which Dark Entries is publishing and releasing in tandem with this new compilation. It’s also called Mechanical Fantasy Box, after Cowley’s somewhat oblique term for San Francisco’s public sex scene during the first wave of mass gay liberation in the United States. In brief, sometimes poetic snapshots of his encounters, Cowley evinces a poignant shamelessness about loving sex with men.To hear him tell it, Cowley was enthralled by the sex he was having—so many great asses, so many great cocks, and such prowess. “I could never take the fuck I give,” he brags. In addition to the graphic sex, his writings contain sprinklings of romance and momentary ambivalence regarding his fast lifestyle (“The churning, crowded heat of men in a sexual banquet crowds in on me and the forced-by-circumstances emotion-lacking atmosphere drives me away”). There’s also a real sense of the brotherhood that the ritualistic scene could foster for a lapsed Catholic like Cowley: “I’m on my knees worshipping Phallus. All around me are the other similarly engaged. I feel the one-ness of our activity. Silent yet all things understood.”Some passages are breathtakingly moving coming from someone who had no idea that his life would be taken from him in a few short years. “This is a sweet sex and the feeling flows with the juices. Let the feelings flow. The longer you love, the longer you live,” he wrote in 1976. In ’77, he recalled telling a partner, “I know I’m going to be 50 yrs old and be able to look back and say, ‘I spent what I had to spend and used what was mine to use as it was intended.’” Cowley, who didn’t live to see 33, then wrote, “I loved it up.”The book is also the rare opportunity to hear directly from Cowley; because interviews with him are not easily accessible online, much of what there is to learn about his life comes only through secondhand accounts of the people who knew and loved him (and many of them, of course, have also since died). To his fans, he’s existed as a myth. The one-two punch of the Mechanical Fantasy Box release and the journals represents a balanced portrait of the way Cowley lived, to hear some tell it. “He really didn’t have much of a social life. It was just music and the baths, music and the baths,” said Cowley collaborator Frank Loverde, quoted in Joshua Gamson’s 2005 biography The Fabulous Sylvester. Though this sounds like quite a social life to me, this quote suggests that Cowley did not compartmentalize his sexuality. It was imbued in his essence.There’s a legendary story, recounted both in Gamson’s book and a 2016 New York Times piece on the Cowley revival, in which an AIDS-ravaged, wheelchair-bound Cowley looks down from a balcony at the Galleria at a dancefloor filled with revelers at a tribute party thrown in his honor, and says, “Those stupid queens, don’t they know?” And indeed, even a few years ago, Cowley’s accounts of the storm might have read as prelapsarian, even tragic. But in an age when proper access to antiretroviral therapies can keep people from contracting HIV and keep people with HIV healthy, Patrick Cowley’s sex journal is a voraciously readable historical document, a seminal text in every possible manner of the phrase. Over 40 years ago, Cowley was a forbearer of the kind of unapologetic sexual liberation that’s currently throbbing through many queer urban centers. His transmissions have made it all the way to the future to culture that is defined in no small part by the potentially lessening grip of HIV, a culture whose history is now becoming a mandatory component of some states’ public-school curricula. “It seems that life is there for the taking and I took my share,” he wrote in his journal. Even today, Cowley is as insatiable as ever.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-24,7.3
Teebs,Anicca,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=electronic"">Electronic</a>","Creative collectives come together through a combination of will and serendipity to make superstars out of those who might otherwise be cult figures, and cult figures out of those who might otherwise never have made music at all. In Los Angeles, starting in 2006, the Low End Theory night at the Airliner was that kind of scene. Many of the names that emerged from there are well known. Then there were artists like Mtendere Mandowa, better known as Teebs. To those who followed what was happening at Low End, he was up there with Flying Lotus and Nosaj Thing, partly thanks to the strength of his 2010 Brainfeeder album Ardour. The record sounded like what would happen if you could plant hip-hop beats in the soil and plug headphones into the flora that emerged.Teebs was a visual artist first; the Low End movement helped him to understand himself as a musician, too. But by 2014, some of the scene’s bigger names had moved onto bigger things. That year, Teebs released an album called  E S T A R A. It was perfectly pleasant. But it felt as if it had been too long since someone pushed him toward anything new.Now, he’s back with Anicca, his first album in five years and his strongest musical offering since Ardour. In lieu of the collaborators with whom he first attracted notice, Mandowa has gathered a new assemblage—some are familiar names, and some of them relative newcomers. Anicca sparkles when it features them, and also when it doesn’t. Teebs benefits once again from a vibrant musical scene, this time one that he’s gathered himself.Teebs’ music begins as beat music and grows from there. The opener, “Atoms Song,” is a good example: It starts with a simple keyboard loop, going around and around. But then synths drift in like wind, elements disappear and reappear, a string section paints the song with light. Before you know it, seven and a half minutes have gone by and a lovely sonic sunshower has come down.One of the things that differentiates Anicca from E S T A R A is its sense of propulsion. There’s constant movement here, and while everything is lovely, nothing lingers too long or lends itself to stasis. Mandowa’s collaborators help keep things moving. Sudan Archives, one of the most exciting Stones Throw prospects in a minute, leans forward over a thumping beat on “Black Dove,” maintaining momentum even when she slows the tempo. “Studie” is replete with all the warmth of early Panda Bear, who arrived at a sound similar to Teebs’ through an entirely different route and who appears on the track to sing, once again, about the perils of social status: “Tripping on the social climb get in line.” (It’s been nice to see Panda Bear start to be understood as a beat-music pioneer in his own right.)  Another standout collaboration comes later in the album as Pink Siifu leads “Daughter Callin’” over a shuffling beat that sounds like great, late-period Dilla.Teebs doesn’t need other artists to sound inspired.  The softly vibrating “prayers ii” seems at first like a standard beat until you realize how the percussion is tempered by strings and synths, the space between each beat breathing and expanding. It’s a track where the time signature isn’t as obvious as you might initially think. “Slumber” opens with a canvas made of strings, shifts its focus to keyboard, and then redoubles the strings; as the keyboard acquires more and more urgency, the strings grow louder and you can just barely hear what sounds like a human voice low in the mix.That might be Mandowa’s daughter, who was born the year after E S T A R A came out and whose voice appears on Anicca, along with sounds created by her mother. Where Ardour was influenced by loss—Teebs’s father died during the making of the record—the new album sounds like the work of a man obsessed with family, and willing to bring his collaborators into his own. Perhaps realizing that scenes dissolve, that friends and colleagues move on, helped Teebs to understand just how important it is to make the best of connections while they’re still available. The word “anicca” refers to the concept of impermanence, and this gorgeous album does move along. It’s over before you know it. While you listen to it, though, time disappears entirely.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-24,7.8
Black Marble,Bigger Than Life,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","The synth-pop grammar that dictates Black Marble’s music is strict and specific. The project formed as a duo in 2012 but eventually pared down to lone member Chris Stewart; throughout, its output has been uniformly composed of the same carefully curated elements. The instruments are hulking hardware synths and drum machines that hum when they power up. Fluid, melodic bass lines immediately recall New Order, but only the dour churn of Movement, and nothing as bouncy as Power, Corruption and Lies or later albums. Hints of the Cure are limited to the floating whispers of Seventeen Seconds. The crumbling production values are inspired by obscure ’80s minimal-wave artists like Iron Curtain; a detached romanticism can be traced from choice moments in the early OMD catalog. Applying this rigid aesthetic to Stewart’s pop-minded songwriting makes Black Marble one of the more disarmingly catchy bands to bear the coldwave tag.Each subsequent release has gradually stripped away a layer of lo-fi filth, and Bigger Than Life, Black Marble’s third album, is easily the cleanest, uncovering a previously buried accessibility. The understated percussion, plucked guitar leads, and bright chorus of “Grey Eyeliner” are given room to interact dynamically, while the anxiously buzzing arrangement of “One Eye Open” makes space for layers of twitchy hooks. Most strikingly, Stewart’s deadpan vocals rise out of their normally garbled catacombs, making for discernibly pretty harmonies and intelligible lyrics. Where earlier albums waded in ugly murk and occasionally broke out in tantrums of noise, Bigger Than Life sounds composed, almost polite in contrast.Ascending from dungeon-grade fidelity doesn’t always work. The reverb coating 2016’s excellent It’s Immaterial submerged detail but also flattened potentially clashing countermelodies and curbed tangential ideas. Without tape hiss to hide behind, the competing synths of “Never Tell” feel cluttered, and meandering intros drag on. And while Stewart has a gift for crafting obtuse melodies, he also has a tendency to recycle bits of his best tracks. “Private Show” calls on variants of the insistent bass progression and elementary drum fills that drove It’s Immaterial high point “Iron Lung,” and familiar rudiments reappear throughout. The sound is less broken and several shades lighter, but the demo-like quality of earlier albums smoothed over crowded arrangements and forgave repetition.The newly audible vocals also offer a better view of Stewart’s ambiguous, impressionistic lyrics. Inspired during the writing process by a car-less existence in his high-traffic home of Los Angeles, Stewart positions many of his characters as passengers observing the city from the window of a crosstown bus, freaky classmates keeping bones under their bed, or lonely introverts looking for salvation in consumerism.The album’s strongest song, “Feels,” marks its most human moment. Hesitantly optimistic synth tones support a wash of memories from an imagined past: volunteering at a blood drive, waiting for summer to bring happier days,  a late-night slot at a college radio station. Though vague, “Feels” succinctly communicates the soft isolation that the rest of the album reaches for but only delivers in fragments. Its friendly melancholy zeroes in on an unremarkable everyday loneliness, the kind felt by introverted DJs in stuffy basements and glimpsed on the silent faces of strangers on the bus.Dialing down the gloom and upping production values is a logical step forward, and when these changes gel, Stewart’s studied goth-pop evolves. Bigger Than Life takes Black Marble aboveground, where some songs bloom, while others struggle to adjust to the daylight after so long in the shadows.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-24,6.6
Jim James,The Order of Nature,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","The friendship between My Morning Jacket frontman Jim James and Louisville Orchestra conductor and music director Teddy Abrams dates back to 2014, the year Abrams moved to Louisville to become the youngest director in the ensemble’s 82-year history. Upon taking over, Abrams immediately started focusing on attracting young locals to the symphony, arguing in a PBS miniseries that funk, jazz, bluegrass, and folk were all not just viable, but fertile sources of inspiration for orchestral pieces. Abrams is also a composer, and thus a collaboration with Louisville native James seemed not as much an “if” as a “when.”It would happen two years later, when James contributed guitar to an Abrams-penned song for Muhammed Ali that was released on the day of the boxing legend’s funeral. Now, the two of them have gone in together on a full-fledged project. The Order of Nature: A Song Cycle is a nine-song program featuring James as vocalist, recorded live at Louisville’s Festival of American Music last April. Each song is either an original composed by James and Abrams, a classic cover, or an Abrams reworking of a James solo cut—none are from the My Morning Jacket catalog. James sent Abrams demos of these songs in acoustic form, which Abrams then filled out with new orchestral arrangements.The arrangements frame James’ sonorous voice so that it sits at the serene eye of a symphonic and choral hurricane. James lovingly interprets Nina Simone on the Charles Reuben-penned “The Human Touch” and later puts his own spin on Simone’s version of “Who Am I?” the Louisville Orchestra keeping him surrounded and supported, not suffocated. When James bellows to the heavens on the latter, “Will I ever live again?/As a mountain lion, or a rooster, or a hennn?” it’s equal parts spiritual and goofy. That’s a familiar mode for James, but not so much for Abrams, who simply follows his lead and crafts an avalanching grand-piano podium for James to project from.Some of James’ solo songs struggle to emerge from under the shadow of their former selves. “Here in Spirit” and “Same Old Lie” were highlights on James’ psychedelic Eternally Even, but Abrams’ cinematic grandiosity swamps them. Compared to the fine-grained studio versions, they just sound flat-footed.Conversely, Abrams’ rollicking arrangement on “Over and Over”—the third official version of the song that James has released in two years, after it appeared last year on Uniform Distortion and its rearranged companion album Uniform Clarity—fluffs it with Bacharach-ian details, its trumpet micro-gusts and lush strings ushering it towards a brightness that the two prior versions couldn’t unlock. That blissful feel creates a new, suddenly essential contrast with James’ lyrics about the tragedy of repeated mistakes; after all, the idea that “we drop the same bombs” and “we shed the same blood” is about as irrational as layering happy brass and a fiddle solo over such grim sentiments. The song’s impact practically doubles. This sounds like the version it was meant to be, the best one.The loose thread binding the album is Mother Earth’s ability to unite—or as James has put it, “the fact that nature doesn’t know how to hate.” But for every ounce of energy that The Order of Nature spends preaching peace, harmony, and the wonders of the great outdoors, it burns more working overtime to convince newcomers of the power and magic of the Louisville Orchestra. “Back to the End of the World,” the album’s majestic center, nibbles a melody from the Fred Neil-penned, Harry Nilsson-popularized “Everybody’s Talkin’” and Bruce Channel’s “Hey! Baby.” It’s lovely and rich, but like much of the album, it also strains a bit in reaching across the classical-pop divide. In Abrams’ own words, when it comes to writing music, “it’s really important that the atmosphere matches the experience.” But the merging of Abrams’ and James’ worlds owes more to geography than to atmosphere. That makes The Order of Nature something of an inherent gamble. The two composers end up breaking even.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-23,6.3
Homeboy Sandman,Dusty,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rap"">Rap</a>","To hear Homeboy Sandman tell it, he’s in a great place now, contented and spinning raps for the pure joy of it. The Queens-bred rapper’s ninth album, Dusty, is his first on Mello Music Group since parting with Stones Throw, and he’s said that it is his most uninhibited release, one in which he allows parts of himself he’s kept in check to “flourish and surface.” But what mostly comes through on Dusty is what he’s already communicated, over and over again—he’s a technically accomplished rapper, and...well, that’s about it. If you’re looking for someone who will cram words like “hypotenuse” into verses, this is the album for you.It must be mentioned as a baseline: Homeboy Sandman is good at rapping. But it’s the kind of good that treats words as a means to an end; that end being proving he’s good at rapping. It’s an empty loop, exacerbated by the fact that he isn’t rapping about much of anything else in particular, save for the weaklings who aren’t measuring up the standards he’s setting. “I don’t wanna be associated with these dudes/Take a peek inside the dossier of a recluse/Who ain’t gonna pretend a serving size is a teaspoon,” he raps on “Far Out,” without going any further out. He’s far from done clearing his throat: “The difference between you and me/Could fill the sun and earth, moon and sea,” he spits on “Live and Breathe.”His only other discernible interest is sex, and on “Pussy” he turns his pursuit of it into a Seussian rhyme: “I love it more than rapping or eating/I love it more than napping or reading.” “Wondering Why,” which is just a string of rapped hypothetical questions, was executed more effectively by Jadakiss in 2004. One question Sandman never asks himself, but should’ve: What, exactly, is the point of all this?On any of Sandman’s songs, there are moments that can make you marvel at the wit of his wordplay or the detailed arrangement of his raps themselves, their sequence and structure. Every now and then, he’ll articulate an idea perfectly: “I deal in the absolutes/Exact as a science/One synapse at a time’s how I spend my whole life/It’s a spirit thing/It’s in here/It keeps me from hearing things” (“Always”). Or he’ll strike a nice balance between his left and right brain: “Greatest look since dinosaurs and the protozoa/Greatest hooks since southpaw Rocky Balboa,” he raps on “Yes Iyah.” Over a diverse selection of traditionalist beats by longtime collaborator Mono En Stereo (formerly El RTNC), Sandman is always engaged, but he’s rarely engaging.Sandman clearly thinks of himself as a peerless writer and rapper. But as pure-bars showcases go, it is less personal than Young M.A’s Herstory in the Making, less colorful than super-producer team-ups from Danny Brown and Freddie Gibbs. He’s not as thoughtful as MIKE or MAVI. His more immediate peers, guys like Quelle Chris (who appears on this album) and billy woods (who he’s taking on tour), use their lyrical acumen to put finer points on big ideas, and don’t sacrifice any of their outsider cachet doing so. Rap albums don’t need overarching concepts, but they do need ideas, and it’s unclear if Sandman has any of his own worth sharing on Dusty.",2019-10-23,6.1
Foals,Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost Part 2,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","At this point, Foals have settled into their role as alternative-radio festival stalwarts. Ever since the grimy riffs and macho vocals of Holy Fire lead single “Inhaler,” they’ve shown increasing comfort with their U2-sized sound. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing—the build of oft-synched signature song “Spanish Sahara” remains so stirring that its replicants, like “Late Night” and “Sunday,” soar by association. Even if March’s Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost Part 1 was too cluttered to recapture the intimacy of “Sahara,” unexpected detours like the sparse “Cafe D’Athens” and chaotic rave-up “In Degrees” broke through the murky production. Part 2, the band promised, would be heavier still—but mostly it continues the now-standard Foals album formula, dividing its tracklist into Aggressive, Funky, and Somber. It’s not a complement to its predecessor so much as just another collection of Foals songs.Besides, it hardly makes sense to differentiate between a rock and a pop album when every instrument is reduced to overcompressed mush. The band’s brash self-production blows up their sound until all definition is lost. The most disappointing casualty is Jack Bevan’s drumming—once the backbone of Foals’ music, he now sounds buried beneath atmospheric synths and guitars. Not that he has a lot to do: First single “Black Bull” is rhythmically identical to “What Went Down,” second single “The Runner” mimics “Inhaler,” and so on. “Like Lightning” plays like the kind of utilitarian blues-rock that music directors reach for when the Black Keys aren’t in the licensing budget.Foals are most interesting when exploring new territory. While Part 1 shined in its homages to In Rainbows-era Radiohead, Part 2 harks back further to the progressive rock of the ’70s and ’80s. “10,000 Feet” is a half-time Rush homage, down to a repeating “Tom Sawyer” synth. The album’s back half recalls the post-Peter Gabriel, pre-Abacab Genesis, a band that balanced technical prowess with surprisingly poppy melodies. Genesis also evolved from eccentric outsiders to pop stars, and while Foals are too self-serious to embrace the style’s campier elements (leave that to their smarter, more irreverent tourmates Everything Everything), they seem to have tapped an unexpected wellspring. For all their posturing about making a record that “really resonated with the current time,” they’re more at home in old-fashioned prog.The lyrical content, meanwhile, remains virtually unchanged between the two records. This band is famous for its energy, not its insight, and you’d be hard-pressed to hear the political subtext Foals say they’d like to impart. The band describes “Black Bull” as “a conflicted diary of masculine confusion and negative tendencies”; the actual chorus goes, “We not playing around/The black bull’s in town.” Even an intriguing turn of phrase like “turn me into a wedding ring” turns out to be a thuddingly literal reference to a more interesting story: Mexican architect Luis Barragán, whose ashes were turned into a diamond more than 25 years after his death. “Dreaming Of” is made up of references to other, better songs (“you’re dancing on your own,” “you’re always crashing that same car,” “there’s always something in the way”), but at least the magnet-poetry approach feels like a deliberate character study of someone obsessed with looking back instead of facing reality.Rather than forming the second half of a complete statement, Part 2 struggles to differentiate itself. Even with the occasional continuity—like when the earlier “Surf Pt. 1” pays off on Part 2’s penultimate “Into the Surf”—this album could have arrived first with few alterations. “Neptune” and “Dreaming Of” will slot nicely into live performances, but they’re surrounded by songs too effortful to be filler and too unmemorable to be worthwhile. “The defining record of our career, I think we’ve still got it in us,” frontman Yannis Philippakis recently admitted to Dork, but Foals’ career-defining statement is less likely to be a new record than a playlist of all their singles. It’s hard not to lose patience as they trudge towards that album, promising they’re getting closer while moving in place.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-23,5.7
Relaxer,Coconut Grove,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=electronic"">Electronic</a>","Daniel Martin-McCormick’s past always seems to dominate the conversation about his present. No matter how many new groups he’s formed or new aliases he’s tried on for size, his music continues to be evaluated through the lens of his earliest projects. Since 2002, Martin-McCormick has logged lengthy stints in groups like Black Eyes and Mi Ami and recorded solo as Sex Worker and Ital. (Full disclosure: he’s also an occasional contributor to Pitchfork.) Launched in 2016 with a series of five self-released EPs, Relaxer is the New York producer’s latest undertaking, and his new album, Coconut Grove, potentially represents a final, complete break from his noisy post-hardcore roots.More than 15 years have passed since Black Eyes called it quits, but the band’s yelpy, chaotic urgency has colored the perception of Martin-McCormick’s entire career. While some of Black Eyes’ crazed energy did carry over into Martin-McCormick’s subsequent projects (e.g. the tortured glam-pop of Sex Worker and the highly rhythmic post-punk skronk of Mi Ami), he’s spent most of this decade focused on house, techno, and other forms of purely electronic music. As Ital, his initial releases were notably lo-fi, full of jittery intensity and not necessarily primed for the dancefloor, yet the project underwent a major evolution as he moved beyond his playful initial efforts. By the time that Hellhole, the final Ital EP, dropped in 2017, his music was emotionally deeper, more richly detailed and, most importantly, much better produced. Nevertheless, it often felt like listeners’ expectations of sonic anarchy and disarray were still looming in the background; for many, Ital would always be a former punk misfit making weirdo lo-fi house and techno.With Relaxer, Martin-McCormick has effectively hit the reset button. Although he initially launched the alias as an anonymous side project, in 2017 he publicly made the switch and officially retired the Ital name. It was a time of transition, and not just in the musical realm. In 2018, he began work on Coconut Grove, creating the album during periods of what he calls “deliberate solitude” throughout a challenging year. Though he hasn’t been any more specific than that, he has described the LP as “an exorcism, or maybe a rebirth.”Yet Coconut Grove isn’t a morose record. It’s not even particularly dark, especially in comparison to some of the later Ital releases. Martin-McCormick has said that some of the first electronic music that caught his attention, during the mid 2000s, was minimal dub techno, and although he was attracted to the music’s elegance and stripped-down aesthetic, it also lacked the visceral energy and raw emotional release he craved as a musician who was then in his early 20s. More than a decade later, it seems that Martin-McCormick has returned to that particular pool of inspiration, at least in part. Coconut Grove isn’t a dub techno album—the percussion is far too lively for that—but there is a certain patience to the music that feels new for him.Coconut Grove shows a new level of refinement in Martin-McCormick’s music. Songs like “Steeplechase” and “Fluorescence” are brightly colored washes of ambient tranquility, floating along with all the urgency of a cumulus cloud. There’s a slight layer of Martin-McCormick’s usual distortion in the mix, but its presence provides a sense of texture as opposed to abruptly crashing the proceedings and spoiling the mood. The similarly serene “Agony” may sport an ominous title, but the track’s gliding synth washes feel more introspective than melancholy.As good as these ambient excursions are, Coconut Grove spends more of its time on the dancefloor, mostly in a space that could be described as dreamy, melodic techno. There’s a genuine warmth to the record, and although Martin-McCormick still favors battered drum sounds, decaying basslines, and crackling bits of static, the music’s low-end heft sits comfortably alongside its hazy, space-age melodies. “Breaking the Waves” is one of the best examples of this equilibrium, its Balearic synth waves drifting above the song’s breakbeat-ish rhythm and the snarling crunch of its bassline. Album opener “Serpent in the Garden” dials up the melodic acrobatics even further, its bold synths sounding downright buoyant—and veering rather close to trance territory—atop the track’s sturdy techno foundation.The LP does have its more upfront moments. The booming kicks and complex drum patterns of “Um” bring to mind labels like Livity Sound, while the cracking “Born From Beyond” also lets the percussion lead the way, with the help of a sticky vocal refrain and the sort of hovering bass tones that usually populate the background of a drum’n’bass track. Still, these songs don’t feel like outliers, as they retain the album’s warmth and dreamlike atmosphere.Stylistically and musically, Coconut Grove might be one of the safest releases of Martin-McCormick’s career; it’s also one of his best. It may be “just” a techno album, but it’s also a confident statement from a veteran producer who seems to have settled into a groove after years of intentionally butting up against genre barriers and his own production limits. There’s value in that sort of work, but there’s also nothing wrong with an artist leaving it behind once they’ve carved out their own space. Perhaps it’s a function of maturity or simply getting better at his craft, but at some point, Martin-McCormick stopped being an ex-punk dabbling in electronic music and became a proper techno producer who happens to come from a D.C. post-hardcore background. His music has become subtler along the way, but it has also gotten a lot more rewarding.",2019-10-23,7.4
Nils Frahm,All Encores,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=electronic"">Electronic</a>","The German pianist Nils Frahm likes to think big. He is the founder of Piano Day, an annual holiday dedicated to the instrument, and for a time he was the owner of the world’s largest upright, a Klavins M450i, standing a mammoth 14 feet, nine inches tall. (Since the release earlier this year of the M470i, eight inches taller, his model has, alas, been relegated to proverbial second fiddle.) Stages sag under the weight of his live rig, which can consist of Yamaha grand piano, Fender Rhodes, vintage Mellotron, three Roland Juno-60 synths, at least three drum machines, five Roland RE-501 Chorus Echoes, and racks upon racks of sundry effects, mixers, amps, and still more keyboards; darting from station to station, Frahm concocts a throbbing sort of chamber techno, a many-layered mixture of electronic pulses and acoustic timbres. Still, on record, his music often tends toward the opposite extreme: a kind of contemplative, cloistered intimacy.Where last year’s All Melody, Frahm’s most ambitious album statement to date, attempted to bring together those two opposing poles—fashioning choir, strings, horns, gongs, pipe organ, and his usual welter of acoustic and electronic elements into a whole at once vast and hushed—All Encores takes a step backward, toward a simpler, sparer sound. In essence, it represents a set of rough drafts, avenues abandoned as All Melody assumed its final form. All 12 tracks here were originally released on a trilogy of EPs, remnants of a proposed triple album that never came to completion, exploring distinct corners of Frahm’s musical practice.The first four tracks focus on Frahm’s solo piano, with the addition of a brief trumpet soliloquy that opens the second song, “Ringing,” on a particularly mournful note. This is terrain Frahm has explored, in slightly different form, on 2012’s Screws and 2015’s Solo; the pleasure here is in the virtually unplugged proprieties of the recordings—no bells or whistles, just Frahm’s sentimental melodies swimming in the natural ambiance of the Berlin Funkhaus studios, where he recorded. Like All Melody’s unadorned highlights “My Friend the Forest” and “Forever Changeless,” All Encores’ opener, “The Roughest Trade,” is recorded in a way that emphasizes the piano’s mechanics—the clack of the keys as they rise and fall; the soft shuffle of the striking hammers. It amounts to a kind of X-ray of melody in motion, the piano’s wood-and-metal skeleton illuminated beneath Frahm’s pale balladry. None of the other three piano songs have quite the same emotional pull—their melodies are simpler, or simply more forgettable—though the gently swaying “The Dane,” a staple of his live shows, comes close.After “Harmonium in the Well,” an 11-minute study for reed organ and natural reverb (presumably, given the title, the one he fashioned out of a stone well in Mallorca), All Encores returns to the hybrid textures of All Melody, albeit in scaled-back form. “Sweet Little Lie” sets a drowsy piano lullaby against whispering static; “A Walking Embrace,” for piano and swelling synth pads, verges on the maudlin, as delicate—and as dated—as a collection of glass animals. Only “Spells” attempts the climatic scale of All Melody’s most elaborate pieces—a welcome shot of adrenaline just when the album is in danger of expiring from sheer politeness.It’s a shame that “Artificially Intelligent” is less than two minutes long, because its hiccuping spray of pipe organ and wordless voice is by far the album’s most original moment, translating Frahm’s acoustic palette into a form somewhere between Morse code, abstract expressionism, and the markings on seismograph scrolls. But the final two songs are worth waiting for: The hypnotic “All Armed” is a sidewinding cross between Shackleton and Jon Hassell, while “Amirador” layers rich, deep, organ-like synthesizer tones into a shifting ambient etude of filmic proportions. It suggests a new direction for Frahm’s music, albeit one that it doesn’t seem like he’s quite figured out yet. Nearly four minutes of the 14-minute piece are virtually silent—as though, finding himself at a crossroads, Frahm were holding his breath, waiting for fresh inspiration to strike.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-22,6.5
Matana Roberts,Coin Coin Chapter Four: Memphis,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=jazz"">Jazz</a>","Time has no steady rhythm, despite what a clock insists. Matana Roberts, who might agree, saw how the tempo of history seemed to move irregularly through both her own memory and the national one: how choice points seemed to speed up, wane, cut, coda, and hold; how nostalgia coddled, unsettled, blurred, and muzzled moments. “The past: It sits there,” she said in a 2016 interview, pausing to savor a delicious silence, “but it moves.”Roberts is one of those artists permanently disturbed by the wing of a single, broad muse—here the muse being America, boiled in its own blood, disquiet, mettle, and hate. Her self-appointed task across a projected 12-part album suite of what can unsatisfyingly be bucketed as free-jazz (but in reality is more like historical fiction accompanied by a loud bouquet of horns, ouds, and vibraphones) is akin to what essayist Elizabeth Hardwick selects as her lodestar on the first page of her best, wooziest, and final work, Sleepless Nights. “This is what I have decided to do with my life,” she writes. “I will do this work of transformed and even distorted memory and lead this life.” Like Hardwick, Roberts has a firm sense of purpose and a fabulist’s impulse, beginning with a vision of the past—on this album, memories of a young woman whose parents were killed by the Klan, a story loaned to her by her Memphis-born grandmother—and using it as kindling to cannon a hailstorm of paean and shrapnel.History, as it often does, crashes in with savagery. Coin Coin Chapter Four: Memphis is like the other three extant Coin Coins inasmuch as it’s marked by a tumbling of psychic and cosmic ephemera, allowing free improv, folk spirituals, and guttural yawps from throat and sax to mimic the beatitude of a woman’s disguises, passions, and dignity against the thrashings of circumstance. This effort, however, feels firmer, and more fulgid. In this sharper focus, Roberts’ subtractions have an additive effect: Whereas Coin Coin Chapters One, Two, and Three approach women as platforms by which to explode outward into sound, Coin Coin Chapter Four: Memphis focuses more tightly on myth-making by channeling the protagonist in a broadly narrative form. We learn of her father, of her grandmother, of her prayers for safety, and watch Roberts narrate as a vessel for her spiritspeak.Both the pieces that utilize her voice—which is most satisfying in a tranced-out, babble-as-hymnal mode—and those that are voiceless somehow summon the sensation that she and her band have swallowed their instruments so as to transcend them. Roberts’ saxophone in the prologue, “Jewels of the Sky: Inscription”—which capitalizes on the horn’s capacity to blare like what one imagines the sun might sound like if it were played (low, eruptive, juicy)—is divine noodling, astral magma. The epilogue, “How Bright They Shine,” ends on deep, reedy emissions like dispatches from a satellite stuck in time and orbit.Space feels grounded in Roberts’ work, though. Mirages of Chicago’s free-jazz heroes—of which Roberts is now resolutely one—mist through inescapably, but so does the city of Memphis. To call upon Memphis as a signifier of place and time is a choice that irresistibly forces images of its past to projectile into the present: the stuff of Sun and Stax, the Southern rag, Three 6 Mafia, Johnny Cash, the blues. This isn’t to say that she sounds directly reminiscent of them, but instead assumes herself as part of a cultural lineage devoted to confronting the darkness, the grimness, the apocrypha of the South. She summons the same dramatic tensions that surface when staring at a Confederate statue still erect in 2019.At the substrate, Roberts’ work is that of a woman in thrall to the legacies of family and history, but so sensitive to the sharp pains and violent rearrangements of a national consciousness that she needs to experience them instrumentally, which is to say, through her body. In a recent interview with The Quietus, Roberts devotes a large part of her conversation to a fascination with the idea of moving through water as experienced by indigineous and African-American bodies during the transatlantic slave trade. “The way in which free divers use their lungs is something I’m very curious about as a saxophonist,” she says of deep-sea diving without an oxygen tank, a new hobby. “I do a lot of the breathwork that I learned in my saxophone practice now.” That phrase—breathwork—sums the brio and intensity of Roberts’ vision. It should come as no surprise that respiration and inspiration come from the same Latin root, spir: ‘‘to breathe.” The force of Roberts’ breath—first through the saxophone, all endurance and fits and starts; then through time, inflated and vivified—makes bold how much the retelling of history is a necessary game of survival—an ongoing, fluid act of resuscitating the dead.Toward the end of Sleepless Nights, Hardwick closes in on her own memory-remaking with a lapidary line that may as well have come from a chorus in the middle of Memphis: “The weak have the purest sense of history.” It takes no effort to imagine Roberts chanting it in one of her fugue states, reaching crescendo as she stacks the words like a highway pile-up: The weak have the purest sense of history; the weak havethepurestsense of history, theweakhavethepurestsenseofhistory… Roberts’ history-making is impure in a literal, fundamental way—that is, part patchwork, part arch composure, part sacrament—but it’s all extremely real. What she does here, and what she will continue to do, is allow her body’s blood to beat loudly enough so that it matches the irregular rhythms of the past. She inhales and exhales life into memory so as to make it new—or, maybe more accurately, she affords history the brief freedom to breathe.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-22,8.3
White Reaper,You Deserve Love,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","White Reaper weren’t lying on The World’s Best American Band, but they were joking. The shitkicking Kentucky quintet seemed to have enough self-awareness to recognize that their craft —we’re comin’ to your town, we’ll help you party down—was no longer understood as a form of populism, but something as archaic and artisanal as, say, scrimshaw. They might as well be the only American band. So they must’ve been as surprised as anyone when Elektra called their sorta-bluff and made them one of the first new signings in the venerated label’s ambitious relaunch, otherwise focused on reliably massive pop-punk, metal, and country acts. But White Reaper hardly sound intimidated by the fact that You Deserve Love now bears the same logo as their treasured Cars, Metallica, Queen, and AC/DC records. They just went ahead and made the next White Reaper album.“If you hate the new record, then you hate us. The major label didn’t do anything. You should at least know that all the blame is on our shoulders,” keyboardist/hypeman Ryan Hater said earlier this year, perhaps assuming heated discussions about selling out to accompany his band’s throwback aesthetic. Rest assured, there are no quasi-trap beats or forced duets or empowerment anthems like those that typify the radio-friendly unit shifters and mono-genre pop acts now flanking White Reaper on the Elektra website. Singles “Real Long Time” and “Might Be Right” are prime reasons the band considered Music For People Who Like Us as an album title. But there’s also none of the indulgences one could reasonably expect from a band that prophesied their own pill-popping, hotel-demolishing rock stardom two years ago—no string sections, no acoustic ballads. It’s actually their shortest album.White Reaper justify their anachronistic existence the same way they did on The World’s Best American Band: By proving that “rockism vs. poptimism” is a modern creation. Their harmonized guitars, spring-loaded rhythms, and snotty hooks are all referential of Van Halen and Cheap Trick, some of the most popular musicians going in the ’70s and ’80s. White Reaper’s desire to really get on that echelon rather than merely evoke its essence results in the one noticeable Elektra-funded upgrade: You Deserve Love is produced by Jay Joyce, a guy who’s worked with Eric Church, Thomas Rhett, and Little Big Town, but also Cage the Elephant and FIDLAR—straightforward guitar acts whose enduring popularity and total lack of critical favor confound assumptions about rock bands in the streaming era.While You Deserve Love is certainly slicker and more reliant on synths, it’s to the same degree that The World’s Best American Band was slicker and more synth-y than White Reaper Does It Again. More importantly, Tony Esposito continues to successfully walk the tightrope between dirtbag and douchebag, a guy who could easily be cast as a Linklater good ol’ boy with his own band soundtracking the latest well-meaning debauch. “I’ve brought too many drinks with me and a 10-ton bucket of gasoline,” he jokes on the bubbly dub verse of “Saturday.” He’s drunk on nearly every song, either out of spite or feelings of inadequacy or just a desire to escape.But the guys Esposito sings about would be better served by some audible evidence that they’re going against the grain. Whether sanding off the grit of The World’s Best American Band was Joyce or White Reaper or Elektra’s idea, it nonetheless makes You Deserve Love less worthy of Camaro-revving fantasies, even if these total non-gearheads lean into them on “1F.” Watch the videos for “Real Long Time” or “1F” and White Reaper are no longer a throwback to Thin Lizzy or Cheap Trick, but to another fertile era for pop-leaning guitar music: The one that bridged the gap between the New Rock Revolution and The O.C., when dudes in denim jackets with snappy songs about booze and girls were getting snapped up by majors by the dozens. Think of Elevator-era Hot Hot Heat, the Thrills, Tokyo Police Club, or Phantom Planet, bands who pumped out enjoyable singles to sizable fanbases without ever worrying what their success indicated about the future of rock. Pointing out the thematic similarity of “1F” to Rooney’s “I’m Shakin’” is only an issue if you deny that “I’m Shakin’” still slaps.This is how You Deserve Love can be a well-earned success while not feeling like a triumph, the way a filler-free major label debut should be for the rare band that outwardly aspires to it. While the title track of The World’s Best American Band was its only overtly conceptual song, the title itself created an unexpected emotional undercurrent for a band that prefers to be taken at face value. A modestly successful indie band from Louisville declares themselves as The Greatest before they knew they were: It’s wish fulfillment as transportative as any of the prog fantasies White Reaper’s idols put to tape. On You Deserve Love, the risk and rewards are lower: White Reaper aspire to be a very good American band.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-22,6.8
Bonnie Baxter,AXIS,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=experimental"">Experimental</a>","For the last couple of years, Bonnie Baxter has been calling herself a mutant. That’s the term that she and her bandmates in the noise trio Kill Alters have come to prefer for their small community of weirdos in the New York underground. The scene—per one of its most fervent supporters—is “historically psycho,” vibrating with heavy, hyperactive music from artists like Deli Girls, Dreamcrusher, Machine Girl, and Channel 63, among a host of other like-minded freaks. Most of the artists exist on the borders between punk, noise, techno, and rap, but few, if any, belong squarely to any one tradition.Baxter’s music, both under her name and with Kill Alters, is close to the spiritual center of this scene. Over the last half decade, she’s masterminded a handful of hard-to-categorize tapes and dozens of Bandcamp releases, and her prolific output runs the gamut of contemporary DIY experimental sounds. Generally, the Kill Alters material is oozy and psychedelic, while her solo tracks largely hew closer to the dancefloor, offering bruising beats that might sound like techno if she wasn’t consistently destroying them with static and noise.Even in that context, AXIS, Baxter’s second solo album for Hausu Mountain, is wonderfully bizarre. More than half of its 12 tracks are less than two minutes long, but it’s packed with more experiments and in-jokes than most records twice its length. Even in the shortest songs, like the minute-long “GLOWNG TROLLS,” she layers tons of overlapping synth lines and rhythmic interchanges. For a second, it sort of sounds like Hausu Mountain co-founder Mukqs’ underwater electro experiments before collapsing into horror-score ambience and unsettling vocals that suggest a possessed Speak & Spell—and that’s all in just over a minute.Most of the tracks are constructed in this fast-paced, collagist way. It can feel a bit like some of the more surreal electronic music from the late 1990s, like Kid606’s unsettling glitch work or Aphex Twin and µ-Ziq’s Mike & Rich record, but Baxter doesn’t ever let things get too frantic or overwhelming. “SPIRIT ENEMA”—the record’s longest track, at nearly six minutes—transitions from Rephlex-ian acid to stuttery sample torture before settling into a breakdown in which Baxter sings, barely holding in a laugh, “I need some fucking help with my asshole/So please take me to the fucking doctor, thank you very very very much.” Another track, “NO DICC” consists almost entirely of ping-ponging drums and the lyric “I don’t want your dick!” That’s how things largely go: She builds otherworldly, unpredictable tracks, then undercuts off the wildest passages with prankish experiments and goofy jokes.AXIS is a demanding record. Not only do listeners have to have a taste for Baxter’s delirious instrumentals, they also have to swallow her confrontational sense of humor, the combined effect of which can feel, at moments, like Wolf Eyes playing behind a Tim and Eric sketch. But even the most seemingly off-putting moments—like when she starts believably retching at the end of “NO DICC”—feel weirdly infectious. She has a giddy enthusiasm for always making the strangest possible decision for where a song can go next. Each mutation is more exciting than the last.",2019-10-22,7.2
Floating Points,Crush,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=electronic"">Electronic</a>","Sam Shepherd is a meticulous fellow. Whether he’s tracking down a rare piece of vinyl for his voluminous record collection, wiring up an arcane modular synthesizer, or putting together the latest iteration of his audiovisual live show, there’s an attention to detail at work that’s practically unrivaled in electronic music. (Shepherd also managed to complete a PhD in neuroscience a few years back, so he’s clearly no slouch in his other endeavors, either.) The London producer exudes a nerdy yet winning enthusiasm, and each step in his decade-long career has felt carefully considered. Even his impeccable 2015 debut album, Elaenia, which surprised many people by skirting the dancefloor almost entirely, turned out to be a natural evolution of his sound and craft.Knowing this, it’s genuinely surprising that he created the latest Floating Points full-length, Crush, in only five weeks. The album was born in the aftermath of a 2017 tour opening for the xx. After touring Elaenia for a couple of years with a full live ensemble, Shepherd suddenly found himself alone onstage—in 20,000-capacity venues, no less—improvising with just a Roland drum machine and a Buchla synth. While he initially planned to keep things mellow, he quickly threw that plan out the window, choosing instead to embrace a more “chaotic” vibe and warm the crowd up with what he describes as “some of the most obtuse, strange, difficult music of my life.”  It was a risky choice, but the shows left Shepherd feeling invigorated, and he was determined to continue these focused machine experiments once he returned to the studio.Knowing that, you might expect Crush to be an intense, frenzied effort, but in Shepherd’s case, economy doesn’t preclude elegance. While certain elements—a distorted rhythm here, a shuddering synth there—can be traced back to those rough-and-tumble live shows with the xx, the LP as a whole is strikingly melodic and often beautiful, even in its most frantic moments. Take “Bias,” one of the LP’s strongest offerings: The track opens with subdued, almost pensive synth tendrils and brooding baritone, which intermingle and creep slowly skyward before a vibrant breakbeat sneaks in and eventually erupts, yanking the entire production onto the dancefloor.Crush is not hurting for club-ready material. “Last Bloom” is another dancefloor cut with a cinematic streak, with a swinging, slightly off-kilter drum pattern nodding to UK garage as the song’s jaunty melodies bubble along. You could be forgiven for mistaking it for the work of Four Tet or Caribou, two of Shepherd’s closest friends. There’s also no missing “LesAlpx,” the album’s soaring, proggy first single. The track has a lot in common with 2014’s “Nuits Sonores,” arguably Floating Points’ most forceful tune to date, although “LesAlpx” actually goes much harder, veering into proper techno territory as Shepherd layers an array of crunchy modular melodies and technicolor synth blooms atop its sturdily galloping rhythm.Shepherd has spoken often about his early clubbing experiences and their profound impact on his musical outlook, and Crush shows just how much his work carries on the legacy of London’s fertile club scene during the latter half of the 2000s. Those years saw early dubstep dancing alongside underground house, techno, garage, and a variety of leftfield rhythms, most notably in venues like Plastic People, which played host to all-night sessions from artists like Four Tet and Theo Parrish, along with groundbreaking dubstep nights like FWD>>. Experimentation and cross-pollination were paramount, and although this genre-melding moment was ultimately fleeting, it revitalized the UK scene and introduced a new generation of young producers, including Shepherd, whose initial flurry of releases began in 2009.While Crush isn’t an explicit homage to Plastic People (which sadly closed in early 2015), the album does embody the club’s open-minded, music-first spirit. Although the scene that birthed him has long since devolved, Shepherd—a jazz-loving, vinyl-hunting, ensemble-building, classically trained outsider who only occasionally makes what could be described as proper dance music—has nevertheless become a prominent torchbearer for the ideals of that crucial era in UK electronic music. Crush is something of a return to Floating Points’ more dancefloor-oriented material from the first half of this decade, particularly in comparison to Elaenia and 2017’s jammy, rock-influenced Reflections - Mojave Desert, but the LP is also a sonically diverse effort with extended forays into modular synthesis, baroque new age, hyperactive IDM, and more.The quieter passages are some of the album’s best. The stunning  “Falaise” opens the record with a simmering cauldron of trembling synths and strings, the sense of drama building as the music gradually swells into an orchestral crescendo. More delicate is “Sea-Watch,” a gentle sketch that sounds like a melancholy lullaby constructed with a lightly buzzing modular set-up. “Requiem for CS70 and Strings” is another symphonic gem, its combination of classical sensibilities and Buchla-generated new-age wanderlust recalling the magic of Suzanne Ciani’s first solo albums.Crush has its more experimental flourishes too, and it’s in these moments that you can best imagine Floating Points holed up in his studio, tinkering with his machines. The closing couplet of “Apoptose Pt. 1” and “Apoptose Pt. 2” is built atop a foundation of burbling Buchla rhythms, although Shepherd infuses both tracks with a twitchy energy that channels the percussive ping-pong of 1990s IDM. He takes things even further on “Anasickmodular,” where ethereal melodies and a sturdy garage beat are suddenly swept aside as the track disintegrates into a flurry of whirring synths and gnarled drum sounds. The element of chaos is something new for Floating Points, and while disorder may seem antithetical to his generally thoughtful approach, Crush offers proof that Shepherd has quickly learned to harness its noise and power. In a live setting, this material might have the potential to blossom into something unruly, but on the LP it comes across as more mischievous than deranged.Perhaps a little bit of mischief is exactly what Shepherd needed. An album like Elaenia may have impressively distilled Shepherd’s influences into a single, long-form statement, but it also took him five years to finish and largely sidelined his dancefloor impulses. Crush, on the other hand, provides a more complete picture of his artistic outlook, bringing his club sensibilities back into the mix while also feeling like the most relaxed and confident Floating Points effort to date. Shepherd will likely always be someone who dotes on the details, but this time around, he was smart enough to realize that the five weeks he’d spent on Crush were enough. He’d done all he needed to do, and more importantly, he was happy with the result. Sometimes, the most important decision is knowing when to stop.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-21,8.3
Battles,Juice B Crypts,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","With their bracing debut single, Battles offered a new vision of indie rock. The quartet turned prog grandiosity, funk propulsion, and anarchic No Wave spirit into songs Rube Goldberg may have admired. With the vocals of early member Tyondai Braxton or the slew of subsequent guests, they suggested a sort of cyborg pop, as brawny as it was brainy. For a while there, Battles sounded like little else.But Battles have been perpetually beset by instability. Braxton quit after their colossal first LP, 2007’s Mirrored, leaving drummer John Stanier, multi-instrumentalist Ian Williams, and guitarist Dave Konopka to recruit multiple vocalists for 2011’s wild-eyed follow up Gloss Drop. They tried life as a frenetic instrumental trio on 2015’s La Di Da Di. Following Konopka’s departure in 2018, Stainer and Williams return to the Gloss Drop template for their fourth album, Juice B Crypts, gathering a diverse roster of singers to slip into the narrow spaces inside their meticulous instrumentals. Jon Anderson (yes, from Yes) splits the singing on “Sugar Foot” with fascinating Taiwanese band Prairie WWWW. Tune-Yards’ Merrill Garbus, meanwhile, sings on the final two-song suite, “Last Supper on Shasta.”Captivating tidbits rattle inside each of these 11 tracks, thrilling details that, when found, hit like syringes of adrenaline—the synths that seem to scream “Woo” when Shabazz Palaces’ Ishmael Butler finishes his verse on “IZM”; the pitch-shifted electronics that chase Xenia Rubinos like laser-guided missiles at the start of “They Played It Twice”; the West African guitar line that warps into a fractal midway through “Ambulance.” Amid the rubber-band snap of “Titanium Step,” the Pentecostal yelp of Liquid Liquid’s Sal Principato is a pure delight, flashing back to the Talking Heads and Battles’ own early work.But the more you listen, the more these intricacies suffocate inside arrangements too busy for their own good. The instrumental title track seems to ride a dozen merry-go-rounds at once. And the sounds around Garbus simply won’t let her do the work, breathlessly modulating in every direction and stranding her inside the chaos.Many of these songs feel like knots of ideas superficially strung together. “They Played It Twice” pivots between Rubinos’ electrifying lead and mutated breakbeats, but Battles never bother to make the ideas cohere. “IZM” hops from boom-bap thrust to astral krautrock projection, leaving Butler to repeat uncharacteristically pedestrian phrases, clutching them like guylines. Only “Fort Greene Park” shows restraint. Battles slowly build a single theme, sharing it between slicing guitars and spiraling electronics. Just before it spills into bedlam, they lasso it back, leaving something to the imagination.Juice B Crypts is anti-gestalt music, where incredible parts are subsumed by wholes that try to do too much. You’re left to wonder if Stanier and Williams feel they have to prove themselves again. Or perhaps they’re aware that the polyglot power that made their early work so powerful is almost passé now, as the lines between genres corrode. Either way, Juice B Crypts is an act of overcompensation from a duo trying to make too much happen with less.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-21,6.1
clipping.,There Existed an Addiction to Blood,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rap"">Rap</a>","Rap trio clipping. take pride in their commitment to ego death. When they formed they adopted two foundational rules—strict avoidance of first-person perspectives and the word nigga—just to make explicit that their music is not about them. Using found sounds, foley tricks, and imagined characters, rapper Daveed Diggs and producers William Hutson and Jonathan Snipes fabricated entire worlds. Following the space opera of 2016’s Splendor & Misery, which was actually nominated for a Hugo Award following a fan campaign, and the abstract improvisation of 2018’s Face EP, they channel horrorcore.Their third album is named after a lyric from the soundtrack of ’70s horror film Ganja & Hess, a surreal love story in which a vampiric black couple wrestles with their appetite for blood. The movie is lurid, mysterious, and tender, a combination that completely eludes clipping. Somehow, despite the gory source material, There Existed an Addiction to Blood is their most bloodless project to date.Their vision of horror is high-octane, high-concept, and fussy. Technically, there is a lot happening in their meticulous, densely referential songs. Across There Existed an Addiction to Blood there are shootouts, a ScHoolboy Q interpolation (Diggs uses Q’s flow from “What They Want” on “Nothing is Safe”)and a resurrected Bobby Hutton on “Blood of the Fang”—but every detail feels exhaustingly mechanical.As a vocalist, Diggs has the charisma of a metronome and the expressive range of a sock puppet. Performing in a stiff monotone, he exclusively raps fast or faster, enunciating words with crisp diction but never relishing them or giving them life. “And there may even be some meaning gleaming in the streets that they built/On top of dead bodies in the olden days when the pen was a quill,” he raps on “Intro.” “The best menage is a death menage, agree?/ Chest massage with electric rods for three,” he says on “The Show.” You can appreciate the internal rhymes and inversions, but his flow is so robotic it rarely feels like he appreciates themSnipes and Hutson are just as perfunctory. Their production style is informed by film scores and a range of genres, but their beats are dry and lifeless. “He Dead” is a dirge that dissolves into bland ambience. “Club Down,” presumably an ode to shut-the-party-down Memphis crunk, is built around an arid, prickly drone that wanes in and out of focus. Drumless and peppered with EFX, the beat is as vast and empty as an airlocked bunker. The sole outlier is “Blood of the Fang,” which works elements from Ganja & Hess into a throbbing romp that Diggs navigates nimbly. It's one of the rare moments where his flows feel loose and natural.In theory, the pulp and theater of horrorcore should fit clipping.'s skill set. Snipes has done extensive work as a composer for TV and film; Hutson has a background in experimental music, and Diggs is an actor and slam poet. Attention to atmosphere and cadence is essential to all their disciplines, and horrorcore has often drawn from the TV and movie horror canon. What sinks the record is its enduring sense of cosplay. Horrorcore is about terror as a mood and as a state of mind. When RZA mocks suicide, Tyler defiles corpses, or Lord Infamous summons demons, there’s a sense of alienation behind the provocation. The point of horrorcore is to both piss off church moms and find a language and vehicle for rage and misery. But there is no aching, tortured self at the center of clipping., just three fanboys’ overworked hearts palpitating into the abyss. While you can’t deny the imagination, you also can’t fathom the point.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-21,4.5
Sorry Girls,Deborah,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=pop"">Pop/R&amp;B</a>","On their 2016 self-released debut EP, Awesome Secrets, Montreal duo Sorry Girls sounded like they were putting together an audition tape for the Bang Bang Bar. Heather Foster Kirkpatrick’s glowing voice conjured the ghosts of bygone ’60s girl-group singers, while partner Dylan Konrad Obront doused her torch-song serenades in ripples of country-noir guitar and a Badalamentian synth mist as thick as mountain fog. Their first full-length for Arbutus, Deborah, is likewise a fusion of luminous, eerily familiar melodies and obfuscating ambience. But here, Sorry Girls are less interested in capturing a specific nocturnal mood than in exploring the Rorschach-test ambiguity inherent to much synth-based pop music: that is, what some might consider ethereal, post-goth dream pop, others hear as lush, adult-contemporary soft rock.Just as the passage of time has obliterated the rigid aesthetic divisions that once governed pop music and replaced them with genre-agnostic, era-specific radio formats, Deborah imagines an alternate ’80s where 4AD went MOR, and Cocteau Twins shared Top 40 chart space with the Thompson Twins. The album’s directorial analog is more John Hughes than David Lynch, displacing Awesome Secrets’ earthier elements and uncanny atmosphere with soft-focus pleasures and heart-on-sleeve poignancy. Pretty much every song begins in ambient haze before fortifying into the sort of passionate, heartstring-tugging address that could soundtrack a pivotal scene in a seriocomic teen flick. And in true cineaste fashion, Sorry Girls construct their musical mise-en-scènes with an auteur’s eye for detail: Anyone can program a synth to sound like a hit single from 35 years ago, but a true connoisseur of the era recognizes that glassy acoustic guitars (“Something’s Gotta Give”) and breezy harmonica solos (“Under Cover”) were equally crucial components of the ’80s pop palette.And yet, for all of Sorry Girls’ unapologetic invocations of the past, Deborah rarely feels like an exercise in nostalgia—because all its shimmering surfaces can’t gloss over the distress stewing underneath. Kirkpatrick’s voice is both highly expressive and enigmatic: It veers in and out definition like a camera that just won’t auto-focus, echoing the feelings of indecision at the core of these shapeshifting songs. For all its sunrise-summoning optimism, “Waking Up” is really a plea for escape from an unfulfilling relationship (“Maybe I’m waking up to see the ways that I’ve been blinded/By the love that’s in my eyes/I want to send it all crashing down”), while the tropical chillwave of “Easier” sails into the sunset of a tryst as the parties involved lie to each other that “it never meant anything” to soothe their pain. But Deborah counters these portraits of disaffection with vigorous statements of self-determination, like the vogueing piano-house bop “H.O.N.E.S.T.Y.” And with “Give You Love,” Sorry Girls deliver a synth-sparkled affirmation that plays like a spiritual sequel to Robyn’s “Show Me Love,” with Kirkpatrick declaring her intentions in no uncertain terms. “I’m ready to be the one you need, I’m ready to be someone,” she sings to her potential partner—though the bold pop leaps taken on Deborah suggests she’s courting a potentially larger audience, too.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-21,7.1
The Go-Go’s,Beauty and the Beat,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","In 1982, the debut album from the Go-Go’s, Beauty and the Beat, went to No. 1, making the California band the first all-woman group to top the charts with songs they’d written and performed themselves. It was such a big hit that the Go-Go’s were constantly misnomered as the first successful female band, ever. While this conveniently ignored the achievements of their pioneering predecessors and contemporaries, there was some truth to the idea. Unlike the girl groups of the ’60s, the Go-Go’s operated without any men pulling the strings, without a Svengali figure as their shepherd. Their singles “We Got the Beat” and “Our Lips Are Sealed” were international successes, and the band’s faces were all over MTV and on the covers of People and Rolling Stone. It was a long way from where they’d started.As the Los Angeles punk scene emerged in the late 1970s, it was inclusive, diverse, and pioneered by marginalized voices. Bands like the Zeros and the Bags spearheaded a community that encouraged the freedom of self-expression and self-celebration. The scene centered largely around The Canterbury, a derelict, roach-infested apartment building where members of the future Go-Go’s lived. As one version of the story goes, outside a house party in Venice, bassist Margot Olavarria invited two girls to join a band she was starting with drummer Elisa Bello: guitarist Jane Wiedlin, a helium-voiced former glitter rocker known as Jane Drano who was studying fashion design, and vocalist Belinda Carlisle, a former high school cheerleader and Monkees fan-club member who was supposed to play drums in the Germs under the name Dottie Danger until she was sidelined by mono. (Subsequent tellings of the band’s mythology often ignore Olavarria’s contributions, but as Carlisle wrote in her memoir, “she lit the match that started the fire.”) The four novice musicians dubbed themselves the Misfits; they quickly renamed themselves the Go-Go’s.“Everyone we hung out with were all in a band and they weren’t any good,” Wiedlin later told Sounds. “So we figured if they could do it, why couldn’t we?” Inspired by the Buzzcocks’ pop-punk, they wore dresses made of garbage bags and wrote noisy, shambolic songs that celebrated BDSM, taunted music critics, satirized pretentious poseurs, and extolled the grimy hedonism of their digs. “I wanted to throw up on stage, rip my clothes off, and dye my hair,” Wiedlin told Flipside in 1979. Olavarria just wanted to “spit at Valley girls.”Down the street from The Canterbury was The Masque, a ramshackle, heavily graffitied DIY venue in the basement of a porn theater on Hollywood Boulevard where, in May 1978, the Go-Go’s played their first show. Missing at that debut gig was Charlotte Caffey, who they had invited to join as lead guitarist. Caffey, who had previously played bass in the L.A. punk group the Eyes, had never played lead before. Yet her presence in the band was transformative, and not just because, as the band often joked, she was the only one who knew how to plug a guitar into an amplifier. Caffey brought in a pop sensibility, and she and Wiedlin quickly became a writing team; as the Go-Go’s became more technically proficient, their music evolved from punk to pop. “One must admit that the wildly amateurish musical approach of their early days has been replaced by a very competent barrage of near melodic tunes and singing,” one Slash magazine critic noted in May 1979.In the summer of 1979, Bello was replaced by Gina Schock, a recent transplant from Baltimore. Of the five, Schock had the most experience on her instrument and, sensing the band’s potential, she imposed a tighter rehearsal schedule and work ethic. And so the Go-Go’s began their slow transition away from “a serious joke” to simply serious.In 1980, while overseas on tour, the band released a demo for the UK punk label Stiff, led by a rough and tumble version of “We Got the Beat.” Composed quickly by Caffey on New Year’s Day 1980 while “listening to Motown songs, watching a Twilight Zone marathon, and getting high on a cocktail of stuff,” the band’s first hit is a two-minute ode to lighthearted bliss driven by a supercharged, Duracell Bunny rhythm section. Though the song failed to take off in Britain, it was big enough back home in California that their audience began to expand beyond the L.A. punk crowd. In December, facing a competing vision for the band and a nasty case of Hepatitis A, founding bassist Olavarria was replaced by Kathy Valentine, who had been playing guitar professionally since she was a teenager in Texas. With a series of sold-out shows at famed Sunset Strip rock club the Whiskey a Go Go looming, Valentine buckled down and learned the bass in four days. As the L.A. punk scene gravitated toward the hardcore sounds of Black Flag, the Go-Go’s were moving in the opposite direction.Still, the group struggled to find a label. “The one thing I was greeted with without exception from every [record] company was ‘Oh, it’s an all-girl band,’” the band’s manager Ginger Canzoneri later explained. “‘Fanny didn’t make it, the Runaways didn’t make it, therefore girl bands don’t make it.’” Neither of these bands were failures by any definition: Fanny wrote their own songs and were the first all-female band to release a rock album on a major label; teenage rockers the Runaways also wrote and performed their own songs while challenging the confines of girl-group sexuality. Though both bands carved out space for the Go-Go’s to thrive, their successes were defined by a system outside of their creation, a system never intended to empower them.On April 1, 1981, after countless rejections, the Go-Go’s finally signed with I.R.S., a small label that was home to the Cramps and the Buzzcocks. I.R.S. wasn’t their top choice, but its willingness to take a risk on the band was meaningful in the face of pervasive sexist prejudice they’d faced elsewhere. “The other record companies could only see that we were girls; they could never get past that point,” explained Wiedlin in a 1981 issue of Trouser Press. “It was either that we were girls so they didn’t want to take a chance, or we were girls and they wanted to capitalize on that.”Soon after, the Go-Go’s headed to New York City to record their debut, Beauty and the Beat, with producer Richard Gottehrer, a former Brill Building songwriter who co-wrote and produced the Angels’ hit “My Boyfriend’s Back” and later produced Blondie’s 1976 self-titled debut and Richard Hell & the Voidoids’ Blank Generation. The record’s two singles, a polished version of “We Got the Beat” and “Our Lips Are Sealed,” fit neatly into Gottehrer’s résumé of pop perfection. The latter, based on a love letter Wiedlin received from the Specials’ Terry Hall, with whom she was having an affair, encourages optimism amid rumblings of hurtful rumors. “Can you hear them/They talk about us/Telling lies/Well, that’s no surprise,” Carlisle sings, brushing off gossip with the relentless pep of a trained cheerleader.The easygoing pleasure of these two singles is embodied in Beauty and the Beat’s cover. With a washed-out Jacuzzi color palette, it shows the five bandmates posed in towels, terrycloth turbans, and face masks, while on the back cover, individual members lounged in a bathtub pouring champagne, eating chocolates, and reading pulp novels. It was a far cry from the band’s grimy roots; many critics interpreted the girly photos as proof that the Go-Go’s had lost all punk credibility. (In reality, the shoot wasn’t so posh: The group had to return the towels to Macy’s in order to afford food and the Mr. Bubble gave them infections.)Though it was a far cry from The Canterbury, Beauty and the Beat is about what’s underneath the surface of pop music. Rather than relishing the California sunshine, the Go-Go’s evoke their Los Angeles, a glittery, gritty place where punks rule the streets after dark. “Tonite” captures the exhilaration of cruising down Hollywood Boulevard, where the band “get dressed up/And messed up/Blow our cares away.” “This Town” digs deeper into the city’s scuzzy glamour. “We’re all dreamers, we’re all whores/Discarded stars, like worn-out cars,” Carlisle snarls before Valentine rips a gigantic guitar solo. “Bet you’d live here if you could/And be one of us,” she taunts, offering a thrilling taste of their freedom.While their attitude might be cooler-than-thou, the Go-Go’s offer an unabashedly sincere window into their hearts. On “Lust to Love,” Carlisle plunges into her vulnerabilities to chronicle the transformation from casual flirt to lovesick prisoner. Later, on “Fading Fast,” love’s spell breaks after one too many lies. As her bandmates cushion her devastation with mournful harmonies, Carlisle holds the pieces of her heart in her hands and looks forward with herculean resolve. Beauty and the Beat concludes with a chipper mantra: “Can’t stop the world/Don’t let it stop you.” Originally written by Valentine for her band the Textones, the song is not so much about blithe optimism as it is understanding your own potential, a reminder of the determination that fueled the band’s creation.The Go-Go’s later claimed that the first time they heard Beauty and the Beat, huddled together in a car, they wept. “In the studio, we had thought we were making a great punk album,” wrote Carlisle in her memoir. “On hearing the final version, it sounded more pop than we had anticipated.” Here, they worried, was the final proof the Go-Go’s had entirely traded their punk roots for mainstream popularity. But once Beauty and the Beat was released in July 1981, many critics felt differently, calling it a record that “those of you who were embarrassed by pop music can use to say that pop’s okay.” The band quickly changed their tune.One month after Beauty and the Beat was released, MTV began broadcasting. The new channel helped catapult the Go-Go’s toward superstardom. In the video for “Our Lips Are Sealed,” the band drives through Beverly Hills in a convertible, their trademark garbage bags replaced by colorful summer dresses. Dubbed “America’s Sweethearts,” the Go-Go’s were considered “safe, wholesome, and proudly commercial.” Beauty and the Beat hit No. 1, they were nominated for a Grammy, and they opened for the Police on a massive stadium tour.But the trappings of mainstream success did not shield the Go-Go’s from the sexism of the male-centric music industry. “It sounds like a joyous, bubbling celebration by five cute girls, with no thought inside their darling little heads save for tonight’s beach party,” griped NME’s review of Beauty and the Beat. “If this was an album by five guys from the USA it’d be hacked to bits by the critics,” said Sounds. Interviews and reviews focused on the band’s love lives, outfits, and novelty; when Annie Liebowitz photographed them in their underwear for their first Rolling Stone cover, the photo ran beneath the headline “Go-Go’s Put Out.”The band was well aware of their sugar-coated image (Wieldlin once compared the band to Twinkies) but privately rebelled against it. They partied relentlessly, while Carlisle and Caffey struggled with cocaine and heroin addictions, respectively; rumors spread of pranks that involved harassing their tour manager with explicit Polaroids and an alleged sex tape. This dark underbelly of an outwardly bubbly band feels indicative of the contradictions that lurked around the band.While the Go-Go’s achieved unprecedented chart success, there was a cost to this insurrection, one that brings up complicated issues of identity, integrity, and the blurring of genre lines—topics still fully relevant today. Would the Go-Go’s have become so popular if they retained the punk spirit of their early days? Probably not. But was there a way for them to retain this essence and still be successful? Yes, and to an extent, they did. The Go-Go’s wrote and performed their own songs, songs about independence and desire and control. They shifted a paradigm and inspired a new generation of women—from the Bangles to Hole to Bikini Kill to Sleater-Kinney—to make noise on their own terms. The Go-Go’s never hid from where they came from, and they never apologized for where it took them.",2019-10-20,8.3
Vagabon,Vagabon,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","In crafting her self-titled sophomore album, Laetitia Tamko (aka Vagabon) was hyper-cognizant of how the context around her had changed. The unexpected success of her 2017 debut Infinite Worlds meant more resources at her fingertips, but also heightened scrutiny from a public that so often defaults to consuming black women as prophets of oppression and pain. “I was growing really weary of black sadness and seeing how it’s consumed,” the Cameroon-born artist said earlier this year. “I don’t want to romanticize being tortured.” she told Pitchfork.Inevitably, Tamko was folded into the ongoing conversation about the scarcity of visible black women in indie rock—the only world she has known as a practicing musician, having emerged in New York City alongside artists like Frankie Cosmos. She could have dug her heels deeper into the sound that first won her acclaim, but Vagabon is instead a bracing departure, wielding digital sounds and strings alongside her familiar, delicate guitar in search of wider worlds.Tamko produced the album herself and played most of it, and you notice immediately that her voice is subtly foregrounded. The beckoning whisper of Infinite Worlds has become rounder and more confident. This new boldness is matched by her production, which toggles between small-room intimacy and cathedral-sized grandeur. Tamko plays with all kinds of new palettes here, showing impressive mastery over them. On “Flood” and “Water Me Down,” she subsumes the bombast of ’80s and ’90s new wave into her quietly insightful writing. The heartbreaking “In A Bind” combines her tiptoeing acoustic guitar with a gospel choir and new age, “Orinoco Flow”-esque synth tones.Throughout most of Vagabon, Tamko is not shouting to a crowd, but addressing one specific “you,” reassuring them of her love, pleading for them to stay, questioning their permanence, all in service of her own self-determinism. “I belong to no one/You tried hard to be mine/I won’t ask permission from you/We reserve the right to be full when we’re on our own,” she sings on “Every Woman.”Tamko’s adventurousness is admirable, both lyrically and sonically, but occasionally the intimacy of her writing is overwhelmed by her surroundings. The layered arrangement of “Please Don’t Leave the Table” feels muddled, which obscures the simple, evocative chorus: “Please don’t leave the table I’m still eating.” It’s a rare misstep on an album that otherwise uses restraint to its advantage.With its opening and closing tracks, Vagabon forms a sort of self-comforting loop. “Full Moon in Gemini (Monako Reprise)” takes the album’s opening track and tones it an octave down, turning the song from bright and hopeful to easy and accepting. The closed circle feels like a protective gesture, an act of will, a way to book-end her growth and frame it on her terms.

Slikback,Lasakaneku / Tomo,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=electronic"">Electronic</a>","The first thing I heard about Slikback, a year ago, was his prolificacy. A friend, an events promoter, returned from Uganda’s Nyege Nyege festival raving about the young talent who had wowed audiences at multiple performances during the four-day festival, shaking jungle foliage along the banks of the Nile with his unique blend of global bass music and regional African rhythms. Not long after, he performed a similar trick at Poland’s Unsound festival. In the scant 18 months that Slikback, aka Fredrick Mwauru Njau, had been making music, he had reportedly completed hundreds of tracks, the majority of them never heard outside of his live sets or his studio. The first five arrived in June 2018 on Hakuna Kulala, a sub-label of Nyege Nyege Tapes; the next six followed in February. Now, both of those digital-only EPs have been fleshed out with three new tracks and repackaged as a 2x12"" vinyl (or digital) release, making for an opportune moment to catch up with one of East Africa’s most exciting electronic musicians.Where many of the acts on the Nyege Nyege Tapes label work in accordance with specific regional styles—like Otim Alpha’s electro acholi, or the Tanzanian singeli of Bamba Pana, Jay Mitta, Duke, and Sisso—Slikback occupies his own switchbacking lane. The tempos are all over the place, from the slow-motion dembow snap of “Just I” to the 175-BPM assault of “Venom”; a few tracks, like “Bantu Zen” and “Shell,” ride syncopated pulses not too far from late-’00s dubstep. But the tempos of Slikback’s tracks are often a question of perception: “Acid,” which opens the album, starts off torpid, with sludgy 808s punctuated by staccato vocal chops, but a double-time groove soon takes over, flipping a sloth-like creep into a full-on headbang. The same thing happens on “Gemini,” as drawn-out digital death gurgles spin into a rolling footwork rhythm.In place of melody, Njau tends to concentrate on texture and tone color, and those harsh, brittle timbres might be the most distinctive thing about Silkback’s music. Aside from the occasional nod to the TR-808 drum machine, most of his sounds are resolutely synthetic and wrenched apart from any obvious source. A see-sawing riff in “Venom” might be bowed strings or a weeping alien; the main feature of “Rage” is wave after wave of thundering digital feedback, amplified to a speaker-destroying volume.Plenty of contemporary club music—particularly of the “deconstructed” variety—favors this kind of crashing, concussive palette, but little of it displays the rhythmic dexterity that Slickback does. Njau had little guidance when he began producing his music, but a stint working at Nyege Nyege’s Kampala studios changed that: There, Nyege Nyege founders Derek Debru and Arlen Dilsizian introduced him to producers like Jlin and Errorsmith, along with labels like PAN and Planet Mu. After that, Njau told The Quietus, “I began to learn how to let go of what I thought music should sound like.”What he’s come up with so far bears trace elements of those influences, along with bits of grime, trap, drum’n’bass, and singeli; in places, his music has affinities with South African gqom and the spirit, if not the specific sonic tropes, of Afro-Portuguese batida. But mainly it sounds placeless and otherworldly—music from everywhere and nowhere at once. The new tracks here—“Shell,” “Kite,” and “Senshi”—are self-evident standouts that refuse to slot into a predictable pattern. “Kite” is apocalyptic trap; “Shell” could be mistaken for a Livity Sound or Timedance single; and “Senshi,” the heaviest of the bunch, might be a footwork remix of Ben Frost.Shortly before Lasakaneku / Tomo dropped, Hakuna Kulala and Shanghai’s SVBKVLT label jointly released a pair of new Slikback EPs, Slip A and Slip B, far more extreme than anything he’d done previously. Some of that might come down to newfound collaborators like Yen Tech and 33EMYBW, both figures from China’s avant-club underground; mostly, though, chalk it up to Njau’s rapidly expanding vision and chops. Just a little over a year ago, Slikback seemed to appear out of nowhere; now, with his staggeringly original productions—by turns forbidding, malevolent, and scarily disciplined—he’s leading all of us into the unknown.",2019-10-19,8.0
Caroline Polachek,Pang,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=pop"">Pop/R&amp;B</a>","Caroline Polachek named her album Pang after the bursts of adrenaline that jolted her out of sleep. She describes this as an internal thing, the sudden shock of emotion that “pricks you emotionally from the inside.” But it’s corporeal, too; you can’t say the word “pang”—or sing it, as Polachek does on the title track—without a quick release of breath, somewhere between a gasp and a sigh.Pang is Polachek’s first album under her own name (she released 2014’s Arcadia as Ramona Lisa, and 2017’s Drawing the Target Around the Arrow as her initials, CEP) and perhaps not coincidentally, this album centers on her vocals. The music doesn’t depart too far from her work in Chairlift: a little Tango in the Night sophistipop, a little ambient, and a little from the charts. Her usual lyrical themes recur: living unexpected dreams, getting away with something sneaky-fun, tears in public and in oceans. There’s also that familiar tension between the anonymity of the city and the pastoral, even suburban; on “Parachute,” Polachek sings about love as a force pulling her “back to strip malls, highways, and treetops.” The scope of Pang, however, is wider.She produced much of the album with PC Music’s Danny L Harle, and massively tones down his fripperies. At times, there’s a new age or modern classical tinge to the arrangements. Sometimes Pang sounds so sweeping it’s almost symphonic; the first few notes of “The Gate” almost sound like a synthetic orchestra tuning up. It’s a PR cliché to tout artists’ “classical training,” which can mean anything from actual classical training to a semester of voice lessons in college, but in her work, you genuinely can hear it. She’s mentioned writing melodies as wordless stretches of singing—she calls it “applesaucing.” For most of the decade, she’s taken classical voice lessons, specifically in baroque singing. This comes out not just in the soaring, near-operatic vocalizations throughout Pang, but in the crisp way she attacks words and syllables, the controlled vocal leaps, and precise staccato.Even more specifically, Polachek took up opera lessons after hearing the version of Handel’s “Lascia ch’io pianga” in Lars von Trier’s Antichrist. The non-traditional recording perhaps inspired her to use her training to non-traditional ends. Melodies that are heavily vocoded or Auto-Tuned often sound a little like a machine-made baroque run. As Polachek put it, “the voice just becomes the ultimate analog synth,” and it’s an effect she goes for a lot: the ornamentation throughout “Insomnia” and “Hey Big Eyes,” the digitally augmented glissando on the “Ocean of Tears” chorus, or the tumble of a vocal run, almost like a guitar solo, from the bridge of “So Hot You’re Hurting My Feelings.” The influence also filters into the instrumental at times, most clearly the harpsichord-esque notes that underpin “Hey Big Eyes.”Pang is such a coherent musical statement that when something doesn’t fit, it stands out. Polachek restructured the album somewhat late, swapping out five songs; what’s left is a sweeping, delicately latticed album with a few odd pop songs. They’re not bad pop songs. “New Normal” matches quick-cut lyrical scenes with a chameleonic arrangement: Polachek’s melody is yanked between two keys, and the instrumental goes from a conspicuously yeehaw opening of slide guitar to an almost dancehall beat to sputtering percussion and vocal clips from hip-hop. Somehow, it all works, but it belongs to an entirely different record. The Andrew Wyatt co-write “Hit Me Where It Hurts” feels like it was intended for Charli XCX—the low, throaty, near-spoken verses are drastically unlike Polachek’s vocal arrangements throughout Pang, but very much something Charli might handle.What those five new songs—“The Gate,” “Pang,” “Ocean of Tears,” “Caroline Shut Up,” and “So Hot You’re Hurting My Feelings”—do have in common is that they’re all love songs about the moment of surrender, the pain preceding it, and the euphoria after. These are something Polachek’s said she’s hesitant to write. Whether this is true—after all, this is the singer of “I Belong In Your Arms” and “Crying in Public,” two of the decade’s most unabashed love songs—one still detects a certain wryness on Pang. “Caroline Shut Up” is the record’s most swooning track, a waltz-tempo love ballad. The title is what she shouts at herself, an exasperated reminder to stop overthinking lest she ruin the moment. She gets punchy and self-mocking in “So Hot You’re Hurting My Feelings.” The arrangement is ’80s, somewhere between “Every Breath You Take” and “Everywhere,” but the scene is ’10s: crying in public over the Snaps you’re getting from your long-distance partner, culminating in the goofy-horny “show me the banana.” The chorus is punctuated, louder each time, with a gasp: the sound of a crush so sudden you feel like running out of the room, or bursting into a grin and never stopping. After all, laughter is a pang too.",2019-10-18,7.3
Hovvdy,Heavy Lifter,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","Heavy Lifter, the third album by Austin “pillow core” project Hovvdy, is a frothy Y.A. bildungsroman of a record, suspended in the moment between first discovery of love and first brush with heartbreak. Will Taylor and Charlie Martin dig through the detritus of youth with frank empathy for the people they used to be. They sing of leaving a small town and “moving to the coast” as though it’s the solution to their problems, and not another problem waiting to happen. They sing to a “friend” they’d clearly like to be more than a friend. They sound, in short, as though they don’t know what they’re in for.The best songs on Heavy Lifter are like dispatches from a cracking cocoon. “Cathedral,” the record’s lead single and best song, finds emancipating joy in the realization that it is “brighter than before, outside” of a repressive church. The song begins in a pew, bent into a posture of prayer; it ends with the cathedral’s doors flung open. Vowing on the chorus to “never come back here” and instead “stay with our friends,” Taylor and Martin repeat the words in a kind of ecstatic chant. “Feel Tall” makes literal the personal growth that first love can inspire: “Any little thing you want, any little thing at all/Want to make you feel tall.” On “Watergun,” expressions of devotion tilt from the naive proclamations of a little kid toward a newfound, grown-up understanding of love as an act of service. A promise to “gladly dry the dishes” lands with exceptional poignancy.What distinguishes this record from any number of other nostalgic indie-pop ruminations on suburban teenhood is the sparkling optimism Hovvdy carry with them. They don’t long to escape, but to accept the good with the bad. Hopeful energy thrums through cuts like “Keep It Up” and “Mr. Lee,” which mine mundanity for joy. The album is not without grey moments of post-adolescent malaise—particularly the devastating “Pixie”—but Hovvdy veer away from self-destruction, instead homing in on connection and intimacy.These songs are grand, inviting backdrops against which the listener can set any number of paper dolls. This is the record’s greatest strength, and also where it stumbles. Hovvdy remind me of many artists I’ve loved, especially the underappreciated folk-pop savants Page France. But with the exception of a few skittering, programmed drums, they don’t innovate on the sound of last decade’s indie pop as much as imitate it. The lack of specificity in their songwriting means that they never quite eclipse their influences. The world they depict is always a bit blurry, like someone’s smeared Vaseline on the lens; any two people in small-town North America could occupy the vague starring roles.This shyness makes a certain amount of sense, given the youth and inexperience at the heart of the album’s story. But the real gut punch arrives at the record’s end, in the final verse of “Sudbury.” As the singer dreams of graduating from “front yard catch” to the Texas Rangers, he recites the street address of a childhood home. That house, and the patch of yellow-green grass that made sports stardom feel possible, couldn’t belong to anyone else. Taylor and Martin are at their finest here, trading the ubiquitous for the unique, declaring who they were and who they wished to be.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-18,7.4
The Muffs,No Holiday,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","Kim Shattuck started the Muffs in the early ’90s as a reaction to the self-serious West Coast alternative music scene blowing up around her. “I was getting really bummed,” she remembered years later. “Stuff like the Red Hot Chili Peppers were happening and I was like, ‘I fucking hate them so much, I have to write the anti-Red Hot Chili Peppers songs.’” So she did, burying shards of Beatles and Kinks melodies in sneering three-chord punk ditties. Once she started, she never stopped.The Muffs signed to Warner Bros. for their first three records, but despite Shattuck’s sticky melodies and instantly recognizable sing-scream, success on the level of California contemporaries Green Day and the Offspring eluded them. Their biggest mainstream moment remains their disaffected cover of Kim Wilde’s “Kids in America”—it plays during the opening credits of Clueless. (Shattuck hated that, too. “The lyrics are not good. Like, they talk about East California. What is that?” she told TIME in 2015.) Shattuck seemed to know her band wasn’t cut out for the big time, and was unfazed: “[Our label has] this job to break our band,” she told Rolling Stone in 1995. “And I totally feel sorry for them because it’s not going to happen.”Instead, the Muffs attained a cult status that grew steadily over the years. By the time Shattuck briefly joined the reunited Pixies—and was subsequently kicked out, possibly for being too extroverted—there was hardly a punk songwriter alive who hadn’t been touched by her throat-shredding screams, lively melodies, and bratty, tender songwriting.So when, two weeks before the release of their seventh album No Holiday, Shattuck’s husband of 16 years shared that Shattuck had died of ALS, the world briefly stopped. Shattuck had never publicly talked about her diagnosis, so her passing came as a devastating shock. An outpouring of grief came from her contemporaries and those she’d inspired. The forthcoming record suddenly took on new meaning: This would be the final time we’d ever get to hear Shattuck’s wail.The songs on No Holiday were written throughout Shattuck’s career, from 1991 to 2017, so it feels like a best-of record, or a retrospective. “We wanted to create something lasting and special,” drummer Roy McDonald said of No Holiday. If a young person hadn’t heard of the Muffs, it would be a safe bet to hand them this record and say “start here.”Shattuck’s voice feels raspier and more raw on some of the album’s 18 tracks, a little less energetic, but the musical chemistry between her, McDonald, and bassist Ronnie Barnett remains untouched by time. At the end of “Lucky Charm,” her voice twinges upward with distinctive snideness: “You should be in the mooo-vieesss, yeeeeah.” It’s good to have her back.On a few songs, it feels as if the full band has been retrofitted onto Shattuck’s acoustic demos. That mix-and-match sound is an interesting but confusing choice: Some of those songs, like “Happier Just Being With You” and “Too Awake,” would have sounded just fine with just Shattuck’s voice and acoustic guitar. The full band makes it harder to hear her, which is—now more than ever—what listeners want most.The most unexpected moment on No Holiday comes in its final track, “Sky.” In contrast to nearly 30 years of sneering, eye-rolling, screeching, and fighting back, on “Sky” Shattuck offers earnest lullaby over just an acoustic guitar and a church organ. “I am laying on the nice cool grass and now I’m thinking/Wondering if the birds can fly straight up and there’s no ceiling,” she sings, tenderly. “I know I can’t touch the sky/I know I’ll wonder why.”“Sky” is a tragically perfect way to close out what is now the Muffs’ final record. Shattuck will be remembered for many things: her outsized-but-undersung contribution to the punk lexicon, her lyrics that were mean and sarcastic and sensitive and sweet, all at once. But “Sky” is a poignant reminder that she was an unforgettable songwriter and a buoyant spirit.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-18,7.8
Third Eye Blind,Screamer,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","If he had less ambition and a lower tolerance for failure, Third Eye Blind frontman Stephan Jenkins could be sipping Mai Tais with Mark McGrath on the deck of a ’90s rock cruise right now, enjoying a life of royalty checks and low expectations. Instead, he’s carried on as if any year might be the one where his group finally reclaims its former glory. Everything he does is a long-shot bid for relevance: He covers Bon Iver, records bold political statements, and generally does the last thing we ask from the second-tier figures of alt-rock’s yesteryear: He tries.Third Eye Blind’s closest corollary is probably Weezer, another band with an extremely online frontman who never lost his thirst for the charts. They haven’t experienced anything like Weezer’s continued success, but they share a refusal to accept middle age as a commercial expiration date.In pop-punk and emo circles, Third Eye Blind’s 1997 self-titled debut is treated with an affection reserved for Weezer’s Blue Album and the Violent Femmes’ debut—nervy, warts-and-all depictions of adolescent alienation. Jenkins is in his mid-50s now, but he hasn’t outgrown that angst, and he still sings in a raw, post-pubescent yelp. His perennial youthfulness remains his most endearing quality, and on the band’s sixth album Screamer, Jenkins Peter Pans his way through a record so improbably infectious that you almost begin to wonder if he might score that late-career radio hit after all.He brings along some younger recruits to boost his chances. Sleigh Bells’ Alexis Krauss injects homecoming-rally pep into the record’s shouty title track, while Poliça’s Ryan Olson punches up the piano-flushed “Got So High” and the lighter-waving “Who Am I.” Billy Corgan is also credited as the album’s “musical consigliere,” though it’s unclear what precisely he contributed to the record beyond some pre-release buzz. The album’s open-door policy helps keep things fresh, and the band sounds more comfortable in their skin than they have since the ’90s. “Turn Me On” and “Tropic Scorpio” are buoyant and bombastic, tinged with EDM-adjacent production that plays off of contemporary Top 40 without pandering to it.Although he’s laying it on less thick than usual, Jenkins’ swaggering vocals remain an acquired taste. He can still be an unrepentantly clumsy lyricist, especially when he breaks out his old sing-rap on “Walk Like Kings.” But overall, Screamer is better than a sixth Third Eye Blind album ever needed to be. It’s unlikely to be the full comeback Jenkins is gunning for, but if Third Eye Blind never score another hit, it won’t be for lack of scratching and clawing.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-18,6.9
Richard Dawson,2020,,"A man wakes in the middle of the night to the glowing screen of his partner’s iPhone. He sees a flirty text from an unfamiliar number and sneaks to the kitchen for a carving knife to enact his revenge. If this were the extent of “Heart Emoji,” a highlight on Richard Dawson’s new album 2020, it would still be a strange, modern horror story. But there’s more. Additional details include the phone’s passcode (daughter’s date of birth), the contents of the text message (“I miss you ❤️”), the unwelcome creatures infesting their home (spider, slug), the music playing in the narrator’s earbuds (classical), and a story of how the couple met that leaves you questioning their power dynamic and long-held resentment toward each other. It’s a lot to process—and this is one of the shortest, simplest tracks on the album.The songs on 2020 all involve first-person narratives that tend to swerve toward grander, anti-capitalist themes, set in Dawson’s native UK. “Obviously a lot of talk has been about Brexit,” he recently told Q Magazine, “but there’s so many other things without the fanfare.” To accompany these complex stories, he makes music that’s equally overstuffed. In “Heart Emoji,” there’s a creeping guitar part—the sound of stalking through the house at three in the morning—and a wobbly synth solo that mimics a blurry unnatural light in a dim room. Dawson himself, a singer whose thick Geordie accent and primal howl seem to emerge from somewhere deep in his stomach, is restless in his delivery, slurring and braying and dipping into a squeaky, heartbroken falsetto to deliver the words “heart emoji,” as if the thought alone might bring him to tears.Those two words—“heart” and “emoji”—offer a good survey of the album’s themes. On his previous record, 2017’s Peasant, Dawson explored the medieval age, using archaic diction and characters whose dark, grotesque humor left you wondering how distant the past really is. But in the present, amid vape shops and YouTube channels, watching soccer and eating brunch, he finds just as much barbarism. “I don’t want to go into work this morning,” he sings in the opening song, “I just want to lie here and play the new Call of Duty.” And if you think there’s a metaphor somewhere to be uncovered, he makes his point even plainer a few lines later: “I refuse to do this filthy work anymore,” he sings, bellowing the word “refuse” several more times until it sounds like he’s having an actual breakdown.It’s Dawson’s least beautiful music, but it’s also his most expressive. By comparison, Peasant was lush, conventional even, with its sing-song melodies and pastoral texture. On 2020, the arrangements are proudly inorganic as they lurch and blast, sputter and break. The long-form structure of the record feels more like a short story collection, and taking it in front-to-back can have an overwhelming, exhausting effect. But unlike the sometimes hopeless characters in his songs, Dawson can wield this glut of information in his favor. The extraordinary first single, “Jogging,” embodies this challenge: Dawson sings about seeking therapy in exercise as he tries to cram his thoughts into its vaguely motivational rock melody. It seems like a tight, uncomfortable fit, and that’s precisely the point.For “Jogging” and several other songs, Dawson took inspiration from conversations he had with fans at shows, and his intimate tone makes you consider words and phrases you’ve never in a folk-rock song before: dehumidifier, voluntary redundancy, Nando’s. There’s a level of difficulty to this combination of banality and mythology (minotaurs and sirens also lurk these songs), and Dawson’s mastery as a writer guides you along without hiding the awkwardness of addressing the world at its ugliest. Compared with other sprawling, self-referential works from this year—say, Lana Del Rey’s Norman Fucking Rockwell! or Bill Callahan’s Shepherd in a Sheepskin Vest—Dawson succeeds by finding surreality and horror in his everyday musings. The title seems pointed, referring both to our near future and the power of hindsight.While the album is placed in hypermodern scenarios, in a world burdened with violence, xenophobia, and generational exhaustion, its most stunning moments lead you to unexpected places. There’s “Black Triangle,” a tale of a UFO sighting that patiently evolves into a less fantastical tale of being dumped for a pilates teacher. Even more ambitious is “Fulfillment Centre,” a 10-minute parable that takes place inside of an Amazon shipping warehouse, transporting you with shuffling sound effects and a robotic call-and-response. “There has to be more to life than killing yourself to survive,” Dawson sings in the closest thing this album has to a thesis statement. Of course, there’s no easy answer, so to follow it, he gives us this thought: “One day I’m going to run my own cafe.” For a minute, the music turns bittersweet and his words feel so tender and close that you could hold them in your hand. And one day, you think, maybe he will.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-17,7.8
Jacques Greene,Dawn Chorus,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=electronic"">Electronic</a>","For some time, Jacques Greene’s curious career was defined by the French-Canadian producer’s knack for fusing different modes of dance music with contemporary pop and R&B influences. Philippe Aubin-Dionne’s curatorial ears (and eyes; he previously worked as an art director) helped him navigate electronic music’s shifting trends. But where his debut LP, Feel Infinite, took an insular approach, Aubin-Dionne’s sophomore album, Dawn Chorus, treats the Jacques Greene project more like a band. Inspired by groups like Massive Attack and Slowdive, he brought on producer and Oneohtrix Point Never collaborator Joel Ford as well as contributions from Brian Reitzell, Oliver Coates, and Julianna Barwick. The result feels at once intimate yet immense—a collection of ruminative dance tracks with a shoegaze heart.The muscular loops of last year’s Fever Focus EP, crafted for peak-hour DJ sets, made for an incremental step forward, but Dawn Chorus largely abandons the pretense of the club altogether. From the instant that the smeared rave sirens of “Serenity” go soaring across snippets of indistinct radio chatter, it’s clear that Aubin-Dionne is just as concerned with kindling introspection as he is with moving bodies. It’s a trick he pulls off differently on almost every track: Rainy field recordings envelop mid-album highlight “Sel,” and spirals of hazy, resampled textures on “Let Go” set the stage for a moody guest turn from Toronto-based singer Rochelle Jordan.Until now, Jacques Greene’s signature move has been to lift melodies from beloved singers like Mario and Brandy, slicing them into wistful refrains. He was hardly the first to repurpose R&B vocals—what up, Burial—but Aubin-Dionne understands that the provenance of his samples is less important than the vocalists’ charismatic timbres, rendered mystical by washes of synth. Instead of falling back on familiar sources, he opts to alchemize his guests’ voices into hooks, occasionally ceding the spotlight altogether, as on “Let Go” and the acid-tinged “Night Service,” with Cadence Weapon. Unfortunately, Cadence falls a bit flat as he rhapsodizes about a night out during the bloghouse days of yore, when DJs used to play the Rapture. It’s charming but awkward.Dawn Chorus is most compelling when the production does the bulk of the talking. Nearly a decade into his career, Jacques Greene continues to hone his sound design and arrangements. Much of Dawn Chorus was recorded at Hudson Mohawke’s Los Angeles studio, where Aubin-Dionne set out to wrangle new sounds from specific pieces of hardware used by his musical heroes. You get the sense that exploring unfamiliar equipment in new spaces has helped him find new possibilities in his own work—that by plunging himself into guitar pedals and classic French-house compression modules, he’s ushered in a new era for Jacques Greene without losing sight of his unique sentimentality. “For Love,” possibly the only track geared for the floor, turns a hit by Canadian disco outfit THP Orchestra into a pumping funky house number with a dream-pop middle eight. The expansive “Drop Location,” co-produced by Aubin-Dionne’s old friend Clams Casino, shows that the cloud rap pioneer’s chilly tendencies pair well with Jacques Greene’s newfound love of distorted drones.The shoegaze influence is most apparent near the end of the album. Hesitant arpeggios waft through a barren Shlohmo-esque atmosphere on “Understand,” while the seven-minute closer “Stars” is a slow-burning meditation on nature and childhood, undergirded by the steady pulse of warehouse drums. Aubin-Dionne’s gleaming synthesizers ebb and flow; the woozy swells and quietly crackling drones flank the spectral spoken-word passages of another Toronto artist, Sandrine Somé. Eventually, Somé trails off, and so do the resonant pads, leaving a lone breakbeat to loop into the ether. The brooding, ambient nature of  Dawn Chorus suggests that one day, Jacques Greene just might abandon dance music altogether—but for now, it’s a form that he continues to reshape in his own way with each new release.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-17,7.7
Screaming Females,Singles Too,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","With a discography ranging from good (All at Once) to great (the Steve Albini-produced Ugly) to secretly influential (“Jonah,” from 2006’s Baby Teeth, predated Courtney Barnett by six years), Screaming Females are among the more consistent guitar bands of Bandcamp-era indie rock. That’s the story told by Singles Too, a 17-track compilation that charts the New Brunswick, New Jersey trio’s 15-plus year career not through its hits—did this band ever have any actual hits?—but through its non-album singles, B-sides, and covers. Some of these songs appeared on 2010’s Singles, but it’s nice to have everything in one place. Luckily, there are enough moments to justify its existence.The first two tracks, 2006’s “Arm Over Arm” and “Zoo of Death,” capture the essence of most Screaming Females songs: fuzzy riffs, singalong chorus, one verse or chorus too many. By 2008’s “No Being Disgusting,” the songs get tighter, and you can hear the band learning to play with dynamics. It’s also the first time we hear singer and guitarist Marissa Paternoster’s signature howl, which often acts as a fourth band member; it sounds like a Greek god yelling into a paper towel tube.Around 2013’s “Ancient Civilization,” Screaming Females start to sound better, though better studios don’t always mean better songs. But because of the comp’s low stakes, it’s not such a big deal that the riffs on “Let Me In” don’t quite add up to a song, or that “Skeleton” would sound better in a pit than on a playlist, or that the melody of “Take It Back” doesn’t stick. The peak of the compilation’s original music, “Pretty Okay” (which also appears on 2014’s Live at The Hideout) and “I Do,” are the songs  that sound most likely to appear on an album. Other highlights include an acoustic demo for Rose Mountain’s “Hopeless” and a remix of All At Once’s “End of My Bloodline” by Sammus and Moor Mother.The bonus CD of cover songs is the real revelation. Screaming Females’ takes on Neil Young, Sheryl Crow, Patti Smith, Guided By Voices, Taylor Swift, and Eurythmics are loose, jammy, and, most importantly, fun—perfect for people who like the idea of karaoke but don’t want to watch their co-workers botch “If It Makes You Happy,” which the band absolutely crushes. There and on “Shake It Off,” bassist “King” Mike Abbate and drummer Jarrett Dougherty prove to be the perfect anchors to Paternoster’s furious guitar playing. Annie Lennox’s otherworldly performance on “No More ‘I Love You’s’” becomes an unexpected showcase for Paternoster’s gentler upper register. It makes you wish there were another Screaming Females song like it.Singles Too doesn’t challenge or complicate Screaming Females’ strengths and shortcomings, and it doesn’t try to. Instead, it focuses on the band’s evolution. This is less “greatest hits” and more “here’s what you might have missed.” It’s as good an introduction as any to a trio that still sounds more similar to its 2005 self than different. More often than not, this is a compliment.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-17,6.8
Anna Wise,As If It Were Forever,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=pop"">Pop/R&amp;B</a>","When you hear the name Anna Wise, you might think first of Kendrick Lamar—but before she sang on his music, Wise was the eccentric half (or one-third, depending on who was in the group) of Sonnymoon, a New York-based alt-soul and bedroom pop outfit. You never knew what you’d get from her: On a song like “The Fear,” she sounded playful, almost cartoonish; on “Things to Come,” she faded to the background, her piercing falsetto reduced to background noise amid clattering bass drums. Sonnymoon made waves in underground music circles, and around 2016, Wise’s light began to shine brighter, magnified by star turns on songs like “Real” and the Grammy Award-winning “These Walls.” Yet Wise kept churning out the same esoteric soul she always had: She released a solo project, 2016’s The Feminine: Act I, a pop-focused set with electro-soul and hip-hop on the fringes, followed less than a year later by The Feminine: Act II. Then, in 2018, Wise and Jon Bap—a noted vocalist/producer and Wise’s significant other—quietly released a collaborative LP called geovariance, an abstract collage of fuzzy vocal loops and tape glitches that foreshadowed Wise’s proper solo debut album.As If It Were Forever isn’t so wonky, though. Mixing quiet storm R&B, ambient, and acoustic soul, Forever is Wise’s most accessible and fully-formed record, the clearest entry point to her catalog. The peculiar tweaks are still there: “Worm’s Playground” opens with a jumble of loop-pedal vocals, and “Coming Home” is just ambient hums coiled into a quick meditative interlude. The guest features come and go, breezing in and out as Wise’s protagonist holds court. Appearances by rapper Little Simz on the self-loving ode “Abracadabra” and rapper/singer Pink Siifu on the sugary, folk-centric “One of These Changes Is You” give the impression of a collaborative effort between musicians who share a love of cryptic artistry and aren’t defined by arbitrary definitions of hip-hop and soul. Forever is like an open mic in that way: The tracks fade into each other, maintaining a sense of continuity that makes the record feel like a 38-minute suite. It’s a head-in-the-clouds LP where the singer dips between reality and surrealism, exploring the fleeting moments—laughing with friends, relaxing with a lover at home—that she wishes could last an eternity. Forever is about breathing in the good times before they dissolve, and understanding that the only constant in life is change.Lyrically, the songs on Forever read like jotted-down missives in an old diary, ink bleeding through its yellow pages. “Abracadabra” runs through the should I or shouldn’t I of new love, basking in the glow of romance and the tension of maintaining desire. But like everything else, the adoration fades. On “Vivre d’Amour et d’Eau Fraîche,” a sultry duet with Bap near album’s end, the two lean into each other, their voices melded into one. Where “Abracadabra” ends on a somber note, “Vivre d’Amour” is an after-hours slow burner, applying sex and tenderness in equal measure. “Your skin on my skin,” Bap sings over warped guitar chords and barely-there drums. “Your path met my path, several doors are open and all of them divine.” Forever isn’t entirely sentimental; “Nerve” is a chest-thumping proclamation of independence. “I’m not gonna play the safe side,” she declares over scant marching drums and background studio chatter. “I don’t wanna live a simple life when I’m not a simple woman.” On a record wrestling with self-doubt and faded memories of the past, Wise is taking life as it comes and on her own terms.",2019-10-17,7.5
Ernest Hood,Neighborhoods,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=electronic"">Electronic</a>","In 1975, the Portland, Oregon, musician Ernest Hood pressed his lone solo album, Neighborhoods, in an edition of a few hundred. He passed out copies primarily to friends, and the album, a curious blend of found sounds and proto-ambient, disappeared into the Pacific Northwest mist. Newly reissued by Freedom to Spend (in a much improved pressing, spread across two discs), it’s not the first such rarity to be pulled from the ether in the 21st century, as YouTube’s algorithm accumulates millions of plays for once obscure jazz and new-age records. But it might be the most uncanny, an album that kindles a sensation not unlike watching home videos of your own childhood.If you’ve sat in the yard at dusk right before the mosquitoes come out, ridden a bike through the suburbs in the summertime, or even just driven around your own neighborhood with the windows rolled down, you’ll hear in Neighborhoods an aleatoric sound set in amber. Who was the fellow that plucked out such moments of everyday life, pared them down, and wove it all together?Born in 1923, Hood grew up in a time when kids ran unsupervised all day long and the most enthralling sound was big-band jazz. Hood picked up the guitar and started playing ballrooms with a jazz band (his brother Bill would go on to have a moderately successful career in the industry), but in the early 1950s, while still in his twenties, he fell victim to a devastating polio outbreak. He spent a year in an iron lung and for the rest of his life used leg braces, crutches, and a wheelchair to get around. He could no longer hold a guitar in his lap, so he took up the zither. At one point in the early 1970s, Hood’s zither could be heard on Flora Purim’s early albums, mixing in alongside fusion stars like George Duke and Stanley Clarke.His own career in jazz might have ended abruptly, but Hood remained a presence in Portland, where he cofounded the KBOO community radio station. (Before his death in 1995, post-polio syndrome took away even more mobility as well as his ability to speak and he became the public face of the Death With Dignity Act.) And while his guitar playing was halted, he continued to study recording and production. Starting in the mid-’50s, Hood began using a wire recorder to collect the sounds around him, eventually upgrading to a reel-to-reel and microphone, assembling his field recordings into “audio postcards” for his radio show. As the liner notes recount, Hood would surreptitiously park around Portland, “blacking out the windows of his car with a dark cloth to act as a windbreaker,” which attracted a fair bit of notice from concerned neighbors.It wouldn’t be until 1974 that Hood started assembling all these field recordings and snatches of dialogue into Neighborhoods, weaving in the voices of his own son and family friends. He was in his early fifties at that point and envisioned the album as a nostalgic glance back at his own childhood, a period rapidly fading from memory in the post-war era. There’s talk of a sunken riverboat and steam-powered trains, and the scrape of a game of kick the can, not all that far removed from what Ray Davies would sing on Kinks albums. But you never get the impression that Hood is pining for these lost times so much as documenting the peculiar similarities between his own bygone youth and what he could hear all around him in that moment.The album opens with birds, barking dogs, a kid tooting on a whistle, a passing car—the kind of stuff that rushes in whenever you pull up your garage door. When Hood’s own zither and synth musings bloom to life, they move with a logic like the wind in the trees, picking up speed and then dying back down, meandering along at their own pace. He gets one of his early synthesizers to chirp along with bird sound in one moment, and then to mimic a tune the kids down the street are yelping the next.Hood’s musical musings never take over, but rather move in and out of earshot. Sometimes he strums a whimsical air like something lifted from Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood, and at other times he echoes a radio tuned to an old jazz song. The synth melody that gurgles up throughout “Gloaming” brings to mind another album that wove together pioneering synth work and field recordings, Stevie Wonder’s Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants. Neither moving toward a song nor getting lost in the other sounds, Hood lets it all come to him. While the recordings are documentarian in their way, the music is as vague and open-ended as daily life. There are moments when you might be hard-pressed to notice Hood’s signature at all.“It hardly matters in which neighborhood you sprouted,” Hood wrote in the original liner notes. “The games we played… and the feelings we experienced… are tantalizingly familiar.” Songs with names like “At the Store” and “After School” could be set just about anywhere. Hood susses out a symphony in the daily noise of American life, like Charles Ives with a portable tape recorder or Norman Rockwell with an early synthesizer prototype. In some passages, Neighborhoods doesn’t feel like a half-century-old curio, but as of-the-moment as a walk to the train. Put it on, hear children shouting out songs, crickets chirping, and the noise diesel engines rumbling past and feel the illusion of time dissolve: You’re in Ernest Hood’s neighborhood.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-16,8.4
Xanman,Broken,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rap"">Rap</a>","There might be more than one other rapper taking their name from one of America’s most popular anti-anxiety medications, but Prince George’s County, Maryland’s Xanman raps better than any of them. The only thing faster than the 19-year-old rapper’s flow is the prolific pace at which he releases music—Xan has released almost 30 projects on mixtape-hosting service Spinrilla in the past three years, though only a handful of those have made it over to Spotify. He’s been making music for much longer than he’s been releasing it: Xan started rapping at age 5 and had his own studio by the time he was a preteen. A six-month stint behind bars on undisclosed charges briefly interrupted his output, but he’s been grinding harder than ever since his release in May. He’s released multiple projects this year, but Broken is the first that approaches retail-album length.Given his age, Xanman’s extensive discography is made even more impressive by being mostly self-produced. Like the state he hails from, Xan’s beats—which he refers to as “Xanstyles”—split the difference between North and South. There’s heavy Zaytoven influence to the glittering keys, MIDI strings, and organ swells on songs like “Broken, Pt. 1,” but an undeniable East Coast love that comes through in his affection for hip-hop instrumentals that he’s barely old enough to remember, like 50 Cent’s “Many Men,” Mary J. Blige’s “Family Affair,” and Lauryn Hill’s “Doo Wop (That Thing).”Whether his words arrive over straight-up trap or something more soulful, Xanman has a fondness for hashtag rap, using punchlines to detail his plans to cause physical harm: “Flava Flav/You get clocked in the head,” “I put that bitch underground/Harriet Tubman.” At its best, Xan’s love of non-sequiturs gives his lyrics a light surrealism, but it encourages some cringier instincts: casual homophobia, jokes about Paul Walker’s death, and some especially regrettable bars about R. Kelly and Bill Cosby.Even then, he lets out his soulful side enough to keep the whole project mostly serious. For as many colorful metaphors Xanman comes up with to describe his guns, there’s an underlying sense of heartbreak, as the album title and cover indicate. His hooks are more often repeated expressions of emotional uncertainty—“Why you gotta be like that?”; “Have you ever been in love?”; “How would you feel?”—than declarative statements.In classic DMV fashion, Xanman doesn’t let the beat dictate the direction his flow takes, almost as if he’s in competition with it. He crams words into tight spaces and lets them spray in rapid bursts, sounding most at home over menacing, mosh-ready beats like “Brick Paper” and “Back Up.” Reigning rap queen Rico Nasty shows up for a co-signing spot on the remix to “Gucci Down,” the closest thing Xan has had to a hit thus far.Xan’s vocal delivery is the kind we’re used to hearing digitally manipulated, but he’s comfortable enough pushing himself into different registers, from a gruff low end to a twinkling falsetto, that he doesn’t need a computer to do it for him. Xanman has a mixtape series called “Luther Xandross,” which seems to suggest how he’d like to think of himself: as a soulful vocalist, not just a rapper. It’s hard to catch every single word he says, but the skill is clear enough.",2019-10-16,6.7
Babymetal,Metal Galaxy,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=metal"">Metal</a>","On their unruly 2014 debut, the Japanese pop-metal outfit Babymetal pinballed from blastbeat belligerence to chiptune clap-alongs, adding a trap interlude for extra cultural currency. Two years later, they fortified the follow-up, Metal Resistance, with power ballads and alt-rock anthems. Their indiscriminate approach to approachability worked: Babymetal count Robs Zombie and Halford as fans, and their brutally cute ode to chocolate ranks as one of this decade’s essential viral oddities. On the day they released their third record, Metal Galaxy, they headlined The Forum.Metal Galaxy is a loose concept album about being dispatched to a distant part of the universe. “We are on an odyssey to the Metal Galaxy/Please fasten your neck brace,” they greet us over a Sleigh Bells-sized, guitar-and-sequencer stomp. But then, that thread mostly disappears, and the real conceit emerges: After touring the world, Babymetal recruit a half-dozen international collaborators to widen their musical net even further. There is a guest verse from Thai rapper F.Hero on “Pa Pa Ya!!” and faceless growling from Canadian grunter Alissa White-Gluz on “Distortion,” which sounds like a Hot Topic-commissioned cover of Taylor Swift. Without the help of guests, Babymetal nod to Bollywood and the Miami Sound Machine. It is an exultant, near-absolute mess.Now a duo after the mysterious departure of Yuimetal last year, Babymetal are still at their best when they hover around their initial idea—harnessing the energy of metal and J-Pop into high-flying hybrids. Metal Galaxy’s closing stretch of songs do just that; the arcing “Kagerou” boasts one of their most undeniable choruses, and you can visualize the epic sweep of stage lights and lighter-wielding throngs on “Shine.” Babymetal have rarely sounded as natural or convincing as they do in these moments.Otherwise, Metal Galaxy teems with embarrassing gimmickry. At the start of “Night Night Burn!,” keyboards mimic mariachi trumpets and the vocalists duet with cumbia drums, shouting “Hola! Ma, Mamma Mia!” like they’ve just emerged from a Gloria Estefan nightmare. During “Shanti Shanti Shanti,” they intone in Sanskrit over tamboura drones and sitar samples, offering a cringey Bollywood approximation.At least those songs are listenable. “Oh! MAJINAI,” an abomination with Joakim Brodén, the lead singer from power metal cosplayers Sabaton, suggests the Dropkick Murphys playing mean at Halloween. “Let’s make a wish!” they yell together in pirate patois.

W00DY,My Diary,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=electronic"">Electronic</a>","After spending the early part of this decade making prismatic pop songs and wheezy techno experiments, Pittsburgh-based producer W00dy has recently settled into a kind of mutant club music that’s built around hyperactive vocal samples and, as the title of a 2018 tape put it, Relentless Kickdrum. In her rhythmic contortions, you can hear the echoes of all kinds of speed-demon dance music: hardcore techno, drum’n’bass, and footwork, among other molar-grinding microgenres. It’s music for ragers, first and foremost.But the real joy of her tracks is: They’re silly. That’s the stated goal of her work, per her Bandcamp page, to “bring absurdity 2 the dance floor.” Without sacrificing the gurning pace of her tracks, she arranges the components in these overlapping, off-balance loops, which blend and blur together in a wonderfully psychedelic way. Listening to her music feels like you’re watching the dancefloor from the center of a lazy Susan, trying to rediscover your center of gravity.W00dy’s latest full-length, My Diary, only pushes her sound further in that dizzying direction. The album begins with a flurry of slurred syllables, fluttering around one another erratically. As “Can’t Resist It” unfolds into more rave-ready shapes, that vocal continues to dart around, like a fruit bat mischievously unleashed on an unsuspecting nightclub. It’s a kind of chaos you can’t help but smile at.There are only four tracks on My Diary, but they’re each so jittery and unpredictable that they feel like they contain a whole album’s worth of ideas. “Came 2 Party,” for example, starts with a slivered vocal and hopscotching kick drum rhythm that sounds like a Teklife record sent through a paper shredder, before morphing into hardcore, acid, and filtered breaks, all within just a minute or two of one another. Each of the tracks—none of which are less than five minutes long—is so stuffed with details and micro-samples that it almost feels like too much for your brain to process at points. It's similar to the approach of rave revisionists like Lorenzo Senni or the many genre-destroying producers that fill surrealist labels like Orange Milk and Hausu Mountain. There’s a sincere joy for the styles that she’s playing with, but a beautiful perversity in how willing she is to mangle them and the speed at which she does so.W00dy has described My Diary as a collection of her “most personal thoughts & feelings.” It’s hard to know what she means by that in a literal sense—there are no lyrics here to speak of—but you can extrapolate a little about her from these four tracks. It’s a portrait of a mind in constant motion, looping back on itself, swinging wildly from unrestrained joy to disarray and confusion, never stopping too long in any particular sound or feeling. That’s probably a familiar sentiment if you too are a sensitive person in the Internet age, watching every day as global tragedies and personal triumphs scroll past you every minute. My Diary echoes that feeling on some level. It’s overwhelming, seemingly by design, but it also offers a balm. You can always dance through it.",2019-10-16,7.4
Mavi,Let the Sun Talk,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rap"">Rap</a>","MAVI is a kid studying neuroscience at Howard University, who is asking existential questions in his raps during his spare time. There is something profoundly mystic—even shamanistic—about how his raps attempt to bridge gaps between the mind, body, and soul, best encapsulated by a lyric from his song “moonfire”: “Cap trapped in my schooling, rap asking for time to spit/Unwinding brain, mind, and consciousness.” Some scientists believe that the same region of the brain that processes language processes spirituality as well, and MAVI seems to be tapping into both at once. “I try to use hip-hop as a conduit to do something, rather than being a composer of hip-hop songs,” he said in April. “My songs are statements, and poems, and equations of their own.” It’s effective to think of his music in each of these ways: as affirmations of deep-rooted personal ideology, enigmatic and beautifully lyrical poetry, and equations to be balanced and then figured out.Released for download on his website and uploaded to SoundCloud as a single, 32-minute-long track, Let the Sun Talk is a young sage discovering the full extent of his powers. These are revelations from the shadows, concealed and mysterious, in search of fresh air and sunlight. “We be hanging in the dark/We surprise ’em with the prowess/If it ain’t to give a spark we’d be still hidden,” he raps on “daylight savings.” The most recent stage of his music, he has said, is about teaching and learning black aestheticism, and the album’s terms and conditions are a mantra on what it means to be “pro-black.” He has classified it as three movements of four songs broken up by interludes, but it can be taken as a lesson in form: As one long song, the album feels limitless, like you’re wading into his inner monologue.MAVI started piecing things together in October 2017 with the mixtape No Roses, full of fleeting but dense songs in pursuit of a clear head. His heavy raps and unsteady flows were supported by a beyond-his-years insightfulness. The names frequently associated with his music are Earl Sweatshirt and MIKE, and for good reason: they too had this same knack for silver-tongued philosophy as teens. Not only have both co-signed MAVI’s ponderous songs and produced a couple of them (on this album), but his music shares traits with theirs. Let the Sun Talk exists in the same loopy, lo-fi realm that governed Some Rap Songs and Tears of Joy. What distinguishes MAVI’s music is its heady, nonlinear flow, as if he’s performing incantations. In the years since No Roses, he’s grown far more comfortable when lost in thought.Some writerly rappers are so obsessive about cramming words together that their rhymes lose their shape. (A self-possessed technician like Logic is so concerned with the formatting of his bars that they’re nearly soulless.) MAVI’s raps have an understanding of capacity and intervals and margin that eludes many seasoned rap veterans. “‘What kinda songs you make?’/I make the kind you gotta read, baby/I leave the silence you can see baby/I weave the darkness you can hear baby/I leave my carcass in the field, baby/I parse my garden on the real daily/And you can sense it,” he explains on “sense.” It’s a spatial awareness that shows great feel and balance. He doesn’t sacrifice meaning for empty tongue-twisting displays. Instead, their equilibrium is dependent on how layered and carefully organized the writing is. (Fittingly, all of his lyrics are available fully transcribed on his website.)Choruses are few and far between, and none of them could be considered “hooks,” which only feeds the stream-of-consciousness flux of his bars. Sometimes he raps like he’s foraging for some sort of spiritual nourishment; sometimes he raps like he’s leaving something behind for someone else to find and decipher. The crypticness can make these songs feel like riddles, but attempting to unpack all they have to offer is crucial to the experience. They start to crack open eventually, and out come MAVI’s fundamental code of ethics. “I’ll take the nigga hitting cars up over cops any day/Who more often called upon for guarding all the chocolate babies?” he asks on the stark “ghost in the shell.” On “selflove”: “Offer free smoke to all the niggas behind a me too/To my niggas: we ain’t free until she free too/To my sisters: we ain’t free until they free too.” Each bar on Let the Sun Talk is building toward something greater.In the album’s waning moments, MAVI raps, “Can’t wait until my raps is more than stashes for my secrets.” It’s interesting to imagine what his songs might sound like if they were more open and direct or they took more of a narrative arc, but what they lack in clarity they make up for in mysticism. Let the Sun Talk rewards (and often demands) close listening and there are instances where parsing the album can be like trying to unscramble a coded message in another language. There are seemingly many answers buried within it, but only you will know when you’ve found yours.",2019-10-15,7.8
Devon Welsh,True Love,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=electronic"">Electronic</a>","There was a strange high-wire thrill to Majical Cloudz, Devon Welsh’s project with Matthew Otto. Welsh proclaimed the simplest and most naked sentiments in a clear but untrained baritone over synthesizers so warped and wispy they felt like they existed only in your head. Their best songs arranged these few elements in space like a score to a David Lynch film, where loud sounds crashed in without warning and confounded your sense of space and time. Nothing that happened felt strictly real. It either worked spectacularly for you or it didn’t; they weren’t a middle-ground act.Since parting from his Majical Cloudz partner, Welsh has continued as a solo artist. His voice radiates the same emotional intensity, and he sings with equal commitment. But he also reinforces what a fragile balance the Majical Cloudz project was. On his second solo record, True Love, he occasionally sounds a little denuded, his voice leaving that uncanny space and becoming the voice of just a guy sitting at the end of the bar. The arrangements scan as simple instead of sparse, and with one of these small elements slightly out of place, everything he does starts to feel a bit flat-footed; lines like “I wanna be just like my stepdad, I wanna be as cool as him/But then the only thing I can ever really find is me” on “Uniform” scrape pavement instead of taking off.But there are also moments here where that unsteady magic kicks back in—“Dreamers” sounds like 2009-era John Maus, painting a sweet portrait of two lovers (“He liked the Beach Boys, she liked the Doors”) and offering a bashful, fist-pump chorus of chanted “yeahs.” It’s exultant but tiny, like the cells of a future teen-movie anthem gathering in a petri dish. “Songbird” marries the finger-picked guitars of Welsh’s last solo record, 2018’s Dream Songs, with the dreamy atmospherics of Majical Cloudz. He stops to admire the way “songbirds sing in the sun,” and his music operates on a similar level—instinctual, beautiful. In place of a chorus, he croons wordlessly at the top of his range. It is a lonely, haunting sound, and it communicates with your bones.Some songs float in the unsteady middle, dipping into near-banality and then catching a draft upward. “Somebody Loves You” might be the most bathetic song Welsh has ever written, on paper—“Heaven is a place I do hope you find,” he sings, enunciating each word as if talking to a small child—but the near-human cries of the synthesizers defamiliarize his words. “Don’t get carried away/Sometimes there’s nothing to say,” he intones on the title track. He sounds like he might be reading them, puzzled, off a milk carton. “This won’t mean a thing unless we try,” he pleads on “Faces,” allowing the word “try” to occupy six syllables.Welsh made this album almost entirely alone, a process that seems to suit him. His introspection is the sort that usually precludes human interaction, and Welsh’s narrator always seems to be reentering the world, raw and shaky, after some defining devastation. “I will turn away from the shivering world/Though I am a child of that old and rotten place,” he vows on “Grace.” But there is no spirit of turning away here, only an embrace from someone who seems ready to break and rebuild himself, again and again, for you.",2019-10-15,7.2
Czardust,The Ra(w) Material,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rap"">Rap</a>","The Ra(w) Material opens with a hazy, slightly off-kilter double-tracked voice chanting, “Caveman, caveman make me a wheel.” Undulating keys and slurry drums kick in next, sounding for a second like they’re two loops running deliberately out of sync. The vocals brag about copping fire from Prometheus and stacking cash like the alchemist St. Germain, before the track is overtaken by the manic sampled dialogue of a religious zealot—at which point the beat dissolves into a misty soul loop. It’s like some fantastically blunted cacophony whose closest antecedent is the Jungle Brothers’ Crazy Wisdom Masters, a record Warner Bros. deemed too experimental to release back in the ’90s.It turns out, the alien rapping voice belongs to Sadhugold, a Philadelphia producer who wears a stocking mask in photos and is best known for crafting beats for the underground cognoscenti that include Mach-Hommy, Your Old Droog, and the Griselda camp. It also turns out that Sadhugold rhymes very well indeed, much in the same sort of syncopated style as Madlib’s rapping persona Quasimoto. Forming as Czardust alongside Virginia’s Ohbliv—a producer whose work is similarly revered in the same circles—the duo have elevated the usual vanity hip-hop collaboration into a maelstrom of head-spinning loop science intertwined with philosophical commentary.The Czardust world is like a puzzle box. Focus on one of Sadhugold’s raps—which are filled with brags like, “Fuck this rap shit, my nig’, let’s wrangle these chickens/It’s time to cash in with self-help books and religion, ya dig?”—and you might find the vocals fading out mid-line to be replaced by one of many cut-and-paste-style speeches. On “Murder He Wrote,” which starts out dominated by a simmering bass line and Gothic choral refrain, a female voice asks if God will heal the Earth from disease. This prompts a frantic response from a Public Access preacher who rattles off a crazed mix of Biblical references and hip-hop patter: “I’m the Lord, motherfucker, not who you thought I was supposed to be… Like my nigga Mystikal say gon’ be that way long after they release Mandela because you nincom-fuckin’-poops don’t know Jesus.” While this unfurls, a snippet of The Notorious B.I.G.'s “Hypnotize” seeps through in the background, tempting the listener to wander into another new pocket of sound.Backed by pained guitar and monstrous bass, “Phantom of the Options” opens as a moralistic rap that includes the question, “Who can turn a terrorist into a sob story?” As you anticipate the second verse bringing forth answers, the lyrics are totally swamped by news reportage documenting the limits and justifications for violence in the name of self-defense. “What are we supposed to do if we can't protect ourselves?” laments a scared voice as the heady track ends.All these overlapping loops and voices could sound haphazard, but Ohbliv and Sadhugold bring things full circle towards the project’s end. On “Serpent Power,” the same verse that opened the album is layered back into the song, linking the myriad sampled speeches about Christianity, the Ku Klux Klan, and Five Percenter rhetoric to the beginnings of mankind. Then on closing cut “Whattup,” Sadhugold zones out and perfectly encapsulates the cosmic Czardust ethos: “I close my eyes and embrace the blackness of space/’Til the colors and the spirit gods is back in my face like, ‘What up?’”Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-15,7.5
Arrange,Blood Dust,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=electronic"">Electronic</a>","Malcom Lacey, a Florida native who now lives near Portland, has been quietly releasing albums as Arrange for ten years. “Quietly” defines both his approach to promotion and the enticing murmur of his music; “washes over you” would be the operative cliché. It’s tempting to call his fluid electro-acoustic pop confessional, but a better word might be confiding.Arrange has always felt like a genuine window into the depths of someone’s private world—someone intense but sweet, someone with whom you feel safe. This is odd, as the music courses with danger: Lacey sings as if he’s voicing scarily vulnerable things with his eyes covered, then peeking out between his fingers to see if the world is still there. Every time it is, he gets a little stronger.Lacey began the project when he was only 17, and it has the air of a long-term therapeutic exercise, or exorcism. Growth isn’t just his process, but his subject, which he pursues with tender, dogged persistence. Lacey’s latest, Blood Dust, stops short of housing an easy epiphany; that would be a very un-Arrange, as he always traffics in more alloyed emotions and muted climaxes. But it does feel like the end of an arc, a survival and a summation—if a characteristically modest one—of a decade.As ever, Lacey’s lyrics are concerned with mental health and family relationships. Throughout the album, blood is wiped from faces, blood is stolen, blood is transmuted from water. Allusive images of generational trauma accrue, abstract but vivid: There is a mercurial lover, a looming father. The album closes, after the glistening folk tune “Never Is,” with answering-machine messages from Lacey’s grandmother. You might feel moved without knowing why—something to do with home and how it moves around.On Blood Dust, 16 songs flow by in barely 45 minutes, but none of them feel incomplete or incidental. Their brevity only accentuates their intimacy, humility, and rich interior detail. Though virtual synths are present, there’s more live instrumentation—keyboards, piano, and especially guitar—than ever before. Arrange emerged from an era of early-’00s laptop loners like Elite Gymnastics, whose quietude was a shadow of sunny chillwave, but it still reminds me most of early Bright Eyes, especially in the low, choked tone of Lacey’s voice.Lacey moves around in time to take the measure of his perspective at various ages, some of them predating Arrange, some plucked blindfolded from the distant future. The album begins with the knocking, drifting dream-pop of “The Lone Ranger,” where Lacey, now almost 27, remembers feeling “the same hate” at 21 that he did at 15. Much later, on “All the Trouble,” he wonders, “When I’m rotten at 83, do you think I’ll be the same boy? When I’m cold at 92, will you tell just who I am?”Much of this language, not to mention the sound, is consistent with what he was doing back on Plantation. But it feels different, more mature and self-defined. Lacey’s music has modeled growth not in the incandescent spurts of much pop, but in the way it actually happens: by degrees so fine as to be almost invisible, with plenty of backsliding and false starts. Instead of someone heroically becoming someone else, it represents someone, even more heroically, learning to be who he is.",2019-10-15,7.1
Kim Gordon,No Home Record,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","The last chapter of Kim Gordon’s 2015 memoir, Girl in a Band, is a kind of epilogue—a bridge to the next volume in the long life of the indie-rock icon. Sonic Youth is over, and so is Gordon’s marriage to bandmate Thurston Moore. Their daughter, Coco, is off at art school. Gordon has left the family’s brick homestead in Northampton, Massachusetts, but instead of returning to New York, where she was a paragon of Downtown cool since 1981, she heads out to Los Angeles, where she grew up. By the book’s final pages, she is wintering at a hilltop Airbnb in Echo Park—a temporary landing pad for the permanent business of starting over. She is making visual art again; she’s showing in L.A. and has gallery representation in New York. Then, as she sits in someone’s car outside her rental, making out, she turns to the reader to confess, “I know, it sounds like I’m someone else entirely now, and I guess I am.”No Home Record—which, incredibly, is Gordon’s first solo album in 38 years of making music—offers evidence of her reinvention: Even longtime fans may find themselves thunderstruck by some of the turns she takes here. But the record also confirms the essence of her creative identity; it’s shot through with sounds and concepts that have defined her work over the years, just presented in a way we’ve never heard them before.This isn’t the first music Gordon has made since Sonic Youth called it quits, in 2011. She and guitarist Bill Nace have three records under their belt as Body/Head, all recorded in the years since the band dissolved. But where the squall of Body/Head’s dual-guitar improv occupies a space not far from SY’s stomping grounds, No Home Record offers something radically new and, in places, almost shockingly contemporary.It’s safe to assume that not many people expected an overdriven trap banger with an African thumb-piano melody as one of the highlights of Gordon’s solo debut—but here we are, and “Paprika Pony” is enthralling: druggy and hypnotic, the kick drum like a cross between a sheet of thunder and a crumpled paper bag. Over an ominous, skulking beat, Gordon half-mutters, half-whispers a free-associative path through the alleys of her mind.As much as Sonic Youth’s whirlwind sound could feel like a self-contained entity, there were occasional glimpses of the world outside, like Gordon’s karaoke-booth Robert Palmer cover on 1989’s Ciccone Youth’s The Whitey Album, or her duet with Public Enemy’s Chuck D on 1990’s “Kool Thing.” No Home Record is clearly interested in getting the hell away from the strictures of noise and indie rock as they’re conventionally understood. The opening “Sketch Artist” might have been made by avant-rap groups like clipping. or Death Grips—an overwhelming bass blast that summons all the slow violence of an earth mover churning up everything in its path.From interviews, it sounds like neither Gordon nor her co-producer, Justin Raisen—a Los Angeles producer who has worked with Yves Tumor and Charli XCX—expected the album to turn out quite like this. Gordon was fiddling around with an old drum machine, listening to the Stooges and footwork producer RP Boo; as inspiration, she sent Raisen an old Sonic Youth B-side called “Razor Blade,” a scrappy acoustic trifle. Then, three years ago, they made “Murdered Out,” a malevolent hurricane of a song, and the record’s direction was settled.Some songs are more low-tech—“Air BnB” is a mammoth slab of bluesy, atonal rock, “Earthquake” is a shimmering drone-folk opus—but the most exciting moments are giddy with the sense of worlds colliding. Noise, techno, and post-punk; custom-tuned guitars and battered MPCs; 808s and overheated bass amps—multiple strains of underground music history pushing together like tectonic plates, building up extreme pressure under the surface. The album’s energy, too, suggests a fusion of New York and Los Angeles, equally suited for stomping down a crowded city sidewalk and sitting in traffic. Whether heard on headphones or car stereo, the crushing bass and battering-ram drums feel like a protective exoskeleton—ideal armor for the days you simply cannot abide another living soul getting in your fucking way.Where Girl in a Band’s prose was was full of “a lot of read-between-the-lines stuff, which is how I am anyway,” as Gordon claims, No Home Record is similarly ambiguous, layering snapshots of an American culture in decline with lines it’s hard not to read as autobiographical. “Get Yr Life Back,” a smoldering, no-wave approximation of trip-hop, surveys the wreckage with an almost animal intensity. On the vulnerable “Earthquake,” she sings—really sings, in a way she almost never does—“This song is for you/If I could cry and shake for you,” before unleashing the hidden blade: “You want me to see you/Are you 12?” (It’s one of several jabs aimed at oblivious man-children.) And the brutally unsparing “Murdered Out” flips the image of customized cars with tinted windows into an unambiguous fuck you: “Murdered out of my heart/Covered in black matte spray/Will you see when I’m not there/…You didn’t even know who I became.”Even at her most pointed, it’s the ambiguities that keep things interesting. Is the giddy chorus of “Air Bnb” (“Air BnB!/Gonna set me free!”) a sardonically peppy sendup of late-capitalist shibboleths, or a genuine celebration of second chances? Probably a little of both. Gordon’s most trenchant truths are not in her words, but in her voice. She has frequently demurred that she is not a singer, but “singer” is far too limiting a word for what she does anyway. In Sonic Youth, her voice could be a jagged knife, a lover’s confession, steam rising from a subway grate. On No Home Record, she takes advantage of a newfound sense of space in the music to explore the limits of her expressiveness, whispering in ASMR-grade tones, the mic so close you can hear her licking her lips between syllables.The best exploration of her voice’s capabilities is “Cookie Butter.” Zoom out, and it’s clear that the song’s interwoven “I” and “you” statements are meant to underscore the way miscommunication is threaded through human relationships. Up close, though, her two-word statements take on a hypnotic minimalism, the force of repetition leaching meaning out of the actual words: “I saw/I’ve known/I remember/I liked/I met/I awaken/I wish/I have/I suck/I approach/I fucked…” On and on it goes, Gordon not so much speaking the words as carving out the syllables with her teeth, until the phrases come to seem almost sculptural, like a series of small statuettes lined up in a row. The song is an artful capstone to a thrilling debut album, one that is an ingenious fusion of sound and idea and a fearless celebration of second acts.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-14,8.4
Lil Tjay,True 2 Myself,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rap"">Rap</a>","Three years ago, a 15-year-old Lil Tjay was sentenced to a year in a juvenile detention center for a robbery. In late 2017, he was released back into the Bronx’s Fordham Heights neighborhood, with a promise to his mother that things would be different. At first, he fell back into his old ways, skipping school to run the Bronx streets. Then, he stepped into a studio for the first time and recorded his breakout single “Resume.”On “Resume,” Lil Tjay sing-raps in a soft voice about his crushes with the charm of a mischievous early 2010s teen R&B star (think Prodigy of Mindless Behavior). At the same time, he reflects on the drug addicts he passes on his block everyday and the friends he’s lost while incarcerated. He perfectly captures the feeling of being a kid in a New York environment that rapidly forces you to mature. That conflict only becomes more profound on the singles that followed “Resume,” which he began uploading to YouTube every month or so. “Long Time” is a bittersweet ode to all of the friends he’s lost; “Goat” reflects on the low points he’s overcome; “Brothers” dredges up the past he’s still trying to distance himself from. By the end of summer 2018, Tjay’s melodic sense was refined and his stories tapped into an emotional honesty that made him a relatable breakout star in New York.Lil Tjay’s music was always suited for singles. There’s nothing wrong with that; so much of rap is consumed through playlists and YouTube videos. But when stretched across a 17-track album, like his debut, True 2 Myself, issues that were irrelevant before begin to surface: uniform vocals, half-cooked production, and writing that pulls from the same stories.True 2 Myself is more like a compilation than an album. On “F.N,” Tjay’s vivid reflections are given life by lush piano. “I was stuck up in the streets, but I had a brain/I ain’t have no money, we was looking for a nigga chain,” he raps, while keeping a steady melody. The album’s intro, “One Take,” is Tjay at his sharpest; every line over the sparkly keys has a purpose, especially when he addresses comparisons to fellow Bronx crooner A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie: “They said I’m the new A Boogie, relax/I ain’t never tried to copy his swag.” Each of these songs is just as good, maybe better, than early tracks like “Goat” and “Brothers”—both land on the album—but lose some of their luster when they’re all run together, and padded out with blander versions of the same piano-heavy street tales (“Dream That I Had,” “Post To Be”).The album format gives Tjay a little room to stretch, something that’s nearly impossible when he’s only releasing one single a month. Some experiments work, like the traditional R&B ballad “Mixed Emotions.” The “BET Uncut” slow jam “Sex Sounds,” meanwhile, is way too much: Hearing him sing “The way you kiss me when I’m stroking deep inside” is like finding porn in your little brother’s internet history.Lil Tjay wants to grow up, and an album feels like part of that process. But Tjay didn’t need an album; he notched a Billboard Top 15 single and became one of the rappers leading New York’s melody-driven scene without one. True 2 Myself is a playlist of soon-to-be singles grouped under the industry-formality heading of an “album.” Inevitably, one of these brooding piano ballads will catch on, followed by another, and Tjay, just like he did less than two years ago, will go on another run.",2019-10-14,6.5
jaimie branch,FLY or DIE II: bird dogs of paradise,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=jazz"">Jazz</a>","On November 6, 2018, trumpeter Jaimie Branch was onstage in Paris, France, screeching out the blues with her quartet. The music was more somber than the jam-based jazz that marked the New York native’s impressive debut album, 2017’s Fly or Die. At the same time, voters in the United States shuttled to the polls for midterm elections. The music was a plea for them to do the right thing. “The blues we played was far from where it got to on the album,” Branch writes in the liner notes of her second record, Fly or Die II: bird dogs of paradise. “But the sentiment remained: It’s a prayer for amerikkka…” In its finished form, the 11-minute “prayer for amerikkka pt 1 & 2”—positioned near the beginning of Fly or Die II—is the album’s centerpiece; its plodding rhythm and searing real talk sets a forceful tone. “We got a bunch of wide-eyed racists!” Branch declares in the song’s first segment, “and they think they run this shit.”With thunderous trumpet wails and airy, sometimes deconstructed arrangements, Fly or Die introduced Branch as a powerful bandleader in the New York and Chicago avant-jazz scenes. Released through International Anthem (the same label that’s put out stellar projects from Makaya McCraven, Irreversible Entanglements, Damon Locks’ Black Monument Ensemble, Angel Bat Dawid, and Ben LaMar Gay), Fly or Die arrived seemingly out of nowhere and became one of 2017’s most acclaimed jazz albums. Centered on triumphant, hard-charging backbeats that oscillated between Chicago- and New Orleans-style jazz, it was a far brighter album than this one. While Fly or Die II is darker, denser, and more experimental than its predecessor, it’s no less resonant.Branch sings on this record—on “prayer for amerikkka pt 1 & 2” and “love song”—marking the first time she’s used her actual voice on her solo music. Don’t expect her to start singing old Nancy Wilson covers; her voice—part raspy alto, part full-throated wail—is best suited for punk rock and takes some getting used to. She’s a gifted trumpet player who doesn’t need vocals to convey strong emotions, and to fans of her previous work, a track like “love song,” which concludes Fly or Die II, can feel weird on first pass. In keeping with the album’s theme, its sarcastic ode to “assholes and clowns” appears aimed at apathetic politicians, though Branch keeps the lyrics open-ended enough to apply to pretty much anyone worthy of such distinction.Fly or Die II is expressly influenced by the political climate. In the second half of  “prayer for amerikkka,” after the beat quickens to a stampeding mix of Spanish jazz, Branch tells the story of a teenaged Central American girl who seeks asylum in the United States. Liner notes detail her journey: She’s separated from her family at the border and deported to El Salvador, where she’s beaten and sexually assaulted. Three years later, she seeks asylum in the U.S. once again, only to be held in a cage in Texas. “She was only 19, they crossed over at dawn,” Branch sings. “Now her mother and brothers are safe in Chicago and she’s all alone.” Coupled with a surging instrumental—courtesy of Branch, cellist Lester St. Louis, double bassist Jason Ajemian, and drummer Chad Taylor—the song lumbers toward you, as if the border agents were coming for you next.The theme continues on “twenty-three n me, jupiter redux,” a moody, shape-shifting composition that conjures doom and panic through dark synth chords, crashing cymbals, and sporadic trumpet blasts. A pronounced marching beat breaks down into frenetic free jazz, churning up an urgent blend of drum taps and loud horns—the sound of the sky falling. Yet Fly or Die II grows more optimistic as it plays, and by the time “nuevo roquero estéreo” rolls around, the album veers to a festive style of Chicago jazz, where the beat locks into a two-stepping rhythm as Branch’s horn soars above it. The eight-minute “nuevo” is the album’s most pop-focused track, a bright spot peering through the overcast. This isn’t the album you play if things are going well; Fly or Die II leans into the exasperation of life in a country that elevates assholes, clowns, and wide-eyed racists to positions of power.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-14,7.8
The Hecks,My Star,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","Since they began in 2012, the Hecks have sounded like Chicago’s least-relaxed band. They approach melody not as a sequence of notes, but jabs. On their 2016 self-titled debut, recorded when the band was still a duo of singer-guitarist Andy Mosiman and drummer Zack Hebert, Mosiman sounded like he was strenuously aiming his guitar, playing either unnervingly on-beat or nowhere near it. His jagged interplay with Hebert recalled the late Women guitarist Chris Reimer, or Talk Talk’s Mark Hollis bashing holes through the solid walls of Lee Harris’s drumming. Mosiman committed to maintaining this angularity in ways beyond his guitar playing, too, whether by singing in a grating monotone or by holding a stoic stage face only slightly less intense than that of the sudden-realization meme guy.Since then, the Hecks added their producer, Dave Vettraino, as a third official member on guitar, followed by a full-time synth player in Jeff Graupner, thereby doubling their personnel. They sound like a completely different band on their sophomore album, My Star, for two main reasons. The first and most obvious is that the grainy recording quality of their debut is out the window; everything on My Star has been recast in sparkling high-definition. The album’s low end is satisfyingly full. Second, and more surprisingly, not a single sound on My Star is out of place; there no “off” notes, no stray threads. Postures are straight, clothes are ironed, and nobody stumbles.As a result, the bizarro world of the Hecks is an entirely different place to spend time; it sounds like it belongs somewhere around the Carter presidency and the start of the jogging craze. “Zipper” sounds like they stayed up for three straight days watching Elvis Costello’s “Pump It Up” music video, then only remembered how to play one repeating measure. “Heat Wave” reimagines the Police’s “Every Breath You Take” as a blank motorik pulse playing in an empty airplane hangar.Mosiman uses his voice primarily for instrumental effect on My Star, more so than on the debut. His lyrics are usually obscured by the band, except for when serving as boilerplate to complete a hook: “It’s tearing me apart” on “Heat Wave,” or “I only wanted to be with you” on the otherwise-fantastic Prince nod “So 4 Real.” The automated quality can be a little suffocating: At one point, he chants the alphabet to the beat, and at another, he counts up to and backwards from eight the same way. Live, the band dances together with stiff, synchronized choreography. That means these songs wind up making a little more sense onstage than they do on record. Nonetheless, there is something poignant in their mathematical rigor; they may treat songs like spreadsheets, but they fill the cells with neon.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-14,7.2
Roxy Music,For Your Pleasure,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","Roxy Music singer and mastermind Bryan Ferry grew up in the sooty industrial North. His father tended to pit horses in the local mine in Washington, where the glum employment options for men were the mine or the steel factory. Roxy Music keyboardist and troublemaker Brian Eno grew up in rural eastern England, where his dad worked as a postman and augmented his meager salary by repairing clocks on the side. Both Ferry and Eno felt rat-trapped by an impermeable class system, perpetuating privilege for the wealthy legacy students at Eton and Harrow. Neither could have afforded college if not for England’s post-war education reforms.Yes, the great flowering of British rock in the 1960s began, obscurely, with the 1944 Education Act. England’s schools had withered, due to years of German bombs in World War II, evacuations of children, and general neglect; a study found Dickensian conditions in village schools, more than half of which still used buckets as lavatories. Among the Education Act’s extensive reforms, two had impacts for the working class no one could have anticipated: Students were required to stay in school until they were 15 and school fees were eliminated, making British education free to all.As part of this scheme, the Ministry of Education accredited more regional art schools and greatly loosened entry requirements. By the late 1950s, those schools had become havens for misfits, truants, and strays, financed by local and government grants available to anyone who could hold a paintbrush. Art school was “somewhere they put you if they can’t put you anywhere else,” Keith Richards (who studied graphic design at Sidcup Art College after being expelled from his secondary school) told Rolling Stone in 1971. Chris Dreja of the Yardbirds later classified his fellow art students as “buffoons and social drop-outs.”Art schools were unruly outposts of free thinking, free drinking, and liberation. A few years ago, the artist Roy Ascott, whose students included Brian Eno and Pete Townshend, told me, “It was very releasing for students to come out of their horrific bourgeois backgrounds into an art school where they could fuck and drink and smoke.” And also learn to play guitar, all under a government subsidy.Collectively, these schools had a transformative effect on England’s rock music. From the time the Beatles released their first UK single, “Love Me Do,” in October 1962 to the summer of 1973 when Queen and 10cc released their debut albums, nearly every significant English band had at least one member who’d gone to art school: the Beatles, the Who, the Kinks, the Yardbirds, the Animals, the Jeff Beck Group, Pink Floyd, Soft Machine, Deep Purple, and Roxy Music, plus David Bowie and Eric Clapton. Of these artists, Roxy Music is the one that most directly translated the radical, emancipating ideas of art-school into pop music. And For Your Pleasure, released in 1973, is their most art-school album, as well as their greatest.During an unsuccessful, dispiriting U.S. tour for Roxy’s debut album the previous year, they shared a few bills with Humble Pie, whose up-tempo boogie incited Ferry to write For Your Pleasure’s most raucous songs, “Do the Strand” (the album’s lone single) and “Editions of You,” models for the ferocity of punk rock. Both songs pledge themselves to the moment: “In modern times, the modern way,” Ferry trills in the latter, and in the former, which opens the album, he begins, “There’s a new sensation.” In “Editions of You,” a song about the beauty of pining for someone long gone, Ferry builds a chilly metaphor for love out of mechanical reproduction and Andy Warhol’s silkscreened paintings.Ferry had studied at Newcastle University under England’s preeminent Pop Art painter and theorist, Richard Hamilton, who compelled his students to consider fashion, pop music, industrial design, TV, comic books, and other dismissed aspects of lowbrow culture. Hamilton was working largely in collages, most famously in his 1956 work, “Just what is it that makes today’s homes so different, so appealing?” where he uses images of American consumerism, clipped from magazines. Hamilton regarded a painting, not as a canvas, but a mood board, an array of inspirations and goals that could as easily clash as blend together. Ferry applied this idea to Roxy’s music, which careened across the past and into what still feels like the future. “Editions of You” jump-cuts from Andy Mackay’s 1950s R&B sax invocations to a madcap, pitch-bending synthesizer solo by Eno, who torques the synth’s frequency control to create what he later approvingly termed “quite unpalatable noises.”Hamilton’s influence was so significant that he later, a bit grandly, called Ferry “my greatest creation.” The most tangible residue of his influence is “In Every Dream Home a Heartache,” Ferry’s macabre, hilarious love song to a blowup sex doll, referring back to Hamilton’s “Just what is it...?” collage. The song is a two-part essay about interiors and illusions—there are glimpses of modern sophistication, but behind it, only horror. “But what goes on?/What to do there?/Better pray there,” Ferry sings, gazing in awe at a mansion. Then the façade cracks. After three minutes of transfixing melodrama and funereal organ, the music stops asymmetrically on the one, and Phil Manzanera takes a staggered guitar solo, chalked with distortion, shaking with vibrato, and phase-shifted through Eno’s signature electronic treatments. Perhaps, the song implies, the modern way is not the best way.In a 1960 lecture, Hamilton said, “In its efforts to gain and hold the affections of the mass audience, a product must aim to project an image of desirability as strong as any Hollywood star. It must have gloss and glamor...” Everything is a product, he believed, including fine art. So Roxy Music was one of the first groups who understood that music is a product in need of a package, a mission that began with their carefully constructed album covers, which are like advertisements for the male gaze. For Your Pleasure was released as a gleaming gatefold, in a blue-black hue, showing a statuesque model (Amanda Lear) in tight black leather, walking a panther, silhouetted by a gleaming urban skyline, while a smiling Ferry, dressed like a chauffeur, waits next to a limo. It was an enthralling, modern image of desirability, danger, sexual satisfaction, and luxe living, a tableau as posed and planned as a fashion magazine spread of Helmut Newton photos. Like a lot of rock, the cover offers adolescents a misleading fantasy of what adult life is like.Throughout the album, the band is puffed up with ideas, and desperate to make an impression. Ferry summarizes his passions for artifice and postmodern thought in manifestos: “Part false, part true, like anything/We present ourselves,” he sings in a theatrical baritone that recalls, at various times, Noël Coward and Dracula. For Your Pleasure is happily pretentious and self-involved, the juncture where glam and prog meet with the greatest degree of success. Glam steals from prog’s song lengths and love of soloing, and prog swipes glam’s exclamation marks and sex appeal.Ferry was drawn to the anxious, feminine side of R&B, evident on the album’s most retro moment, “Beauty Queen,” which the band bookends into a salmagundi of a song, complete with tempo changes navigated by stalwart drummer Paul Thompson. Ferry is dumping a woman who has “swimming pool eyes,” but it sounds more like he’s pitching woo. He lavishes her with purple praise, promises she’ll be fine without him, and carefully lathers his words with his heaviest Scott Walker vibrato. Ferry, with his fondness for dualities, uses theatricality and even camp to prove his sincerity, implying that everything make-believe is also real, and vice versa.For Your Pleasure’s two longest songs, “The Bogus Man” and the album-closing title track, leave plenty of time for Eno’s deviations. This first sketches out a musical design for trance, years ahead of it, with a long, minimalist break that confirms Eno’s mantra, “Repetition is a form of change.” Each instrument mutates, minutely transmogrified, on some mysterious cycle. On “For Your Pleasure,” Ferry makes only a brief vocal appearance. Over the last four and a half minutes, producer Chris Thomas and Eno are playing the recording studio as though it’s an instrument, conducting the song at a mixing board, and building a panoramic disorientation. They add more echo on the electric piano, more reverb on the guitar, phasing, tremolo, the drums slip away, and it gently becomes hazy and puzzling: Chopped-up bits of “Chance Meeting” from Roxy’s first album come in—Roxy are sampling themselves—then Judi Dench murmurs, “You don’t ask why,” and almost randomly, la fin. An album that began with Ferry’s request for your attention ends with Eno placing you in the strange new world you were promised. A new sensation has delivered new sensations of arousal and uncertainty.Roxy aimed for a melding of American R&B and avant-garde European traditions (Mackay’s oboe on “For Your Pleasure” sounds like the last thing you’d hear before bees stung you to death). You don’t hear a struggle between Ferry and Eno, just two guys with similar ideas and a band juiced on its early success and acclaim, trying to get farther from earth while still holding on to the Marvelettes and the Shirelles. The playing is so adept and surprising, and Thompson and Manzanera do such strong jobs of grounding the music’s outlandish shifts, that you only slowly realize none of the album’s eight songs has a chorus.A few months after For Your Pleasure was released, Eno left the band, quitting before he could be fired, and starting an unparalleled career as a solo artist and producer. Bryan and Brian were incompatible. Ferry was a neurotic—Woody Allen trapped in the body of Cary Grant—while Eno was a disruptor. In interviews, Ferry withdrew like a turtle; Eno excelled at them, and talked fluidly about Marshall McLuhan, Steve Reich, or his ample pornography collection. Eno most avidly pursued the band’s androgynous style, and dressed like he was Quentin Crisp’s glam nephew (leopard print top, ostrich feather jacket, bondage choker, turquoise eye shadow). Out of the chute, he was a cult hero, and Ferry grew tired of hearing punters yell “EEEEEE-NO!” in the middle of ballads, or seeing Eno credited as his co-equal.The music had no immediate impact in the U.S., where it grazed the album chart at number 193. The band’s two-album deal with Warner Bros. had expired and the label happily left them go. American audiences, Ferry told a British interviewer, “are literally the dumbest in the world, bar none.”But in England, it was the album of the moment, and Roxy returned to TV’s Old Grey Whistle Test, where Whispering Bob Harris, a stodgy presenter who was still stuck in the ’60s, sneered at them, as he had the previous year as well, dismissing them as great packaging with no substance.The notion that style and substance were contradictory was a holdover from the ’60s, and it’s one that has never gone away, revived periodically by fans and critics who long for seeming authenticity. Years later, those Roxy TV appearances would start to feel almost as significant as the Beatles on Ed Sullivan. Harris’ contempt was recommendation enough for lots of kids, of myriad genders and sexualities, who would soon come to Roxy shows dressed in sparkling tunics, glowing frocks, and immaculate dinner jackets, boys and girls both in drag. But glamor and self-invention were only part of the aftereffect: Within the next few years, plenty of future punks and new wavers went on to art school, where they immediately started acting, dressing, and playing like Roxy Music.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-13,9.5
Chromatics,Closer to Grey,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=electronic"">Electronic</a>","Across nearly 200 releases, L.A.-based producer Johnny Jewel’s Italians Do It Better label has perfected an unmistakable aesthetic. While the music ranges from abstract instrumentals to sugary synth-pop, the design of each record envisions its creators as would-be movie stars and their music as the cult classics we ought to remember them for. Few of the label’s many acts play so directly into the conceit as Chromatics. Since Jewel reinvented his band in the mid-2000s as a dark pop group with a taste for oblique theatrics, Chromatics have imagined their albums as soundtracks, imageless films in the language of music.It’s impossible to discern clear plots or specific characters from a given record, but that’s not the point. Jewel and his band—singer Ruth Radelet, drummer Nat Walker, and guitarist Adam Miller—excel at constructing settings and engulfing them in dramatic atmosphere. For 2007’s Night Drive, it was a meditative, lamplit film noir viewed through a car windshield. Kill for Love, released in 2012, played like a tumultuous, naive romance in the solitude of a Lynchian suburb. That Chromatics can conjure such elaborate moods with little more than a synth, drum machine, and guitar to accompany Radelet’s uncommonly restrained voice is testament to the strength of their vision.It may also explain why these albums take so long to finish. Jewel once said that his writing process involves recording multiple ideas at once, waiting for months, and then revisiting them to bring their meanings into focus. Given this circuitous approach, as well as Jewel’s numerous solo records and film scores, a seven-year gap between Chromatics albums is perhaps to be expected. Closer to Grey was announced only a day in advance, and its arrival wasn’t the only surprise: After teasing the now-mythic 21-track opus Dear Tommy for the past five years, Chromatics had instead put out their most modest record to date. Think of Closer to Grey as an auteur’s niche art project—satisfying to the superfans, though not necessarily winning over new ones.But like clever illusionists, Jewel and his assistants are no less enchanting for their sleight of hand. The subtlest gesture can feel hypnotic or horrific depending on the light. Echoing Kill for Love’s opening cover of Neil Young, Closer to Grey begins with a spooky, stripped-down version of Simon & Garfunkel’s “The Sound of Silence.” The sound of a match strike or a record-needle drop opens the song like the final motion in a séance ritual, before Radelet begins her quiet commune: “Hello darkness, my old friend.” It’s a dead-simple rendition—mostly organ drones, distant synth arpeggios, and a soft drum machine kick—yet it sets the tone for an album set at the witching hour, a sometimes-muddled tale of heartbroken lovers reaching out to the spirit realm.Closer to Grey is most captivating when it indulges these supernatural fascinations. Standout “Light as a Feather,” with its weightless harmonies and shuffling drum groove, feels like a musical ghost story. “I hear a voice, she whispers secrets from the dead,” Radelet sings in her usual demure tone, calling out to herself from beyond: “Nothing lasts forever.” The sense of otherworldly convergence returns on “Whispers in the Hall,” with enough dissonance and tense, Halloween-esque synth loops to qualify as the most ominous song in Chromatics’ catalog. The smoky “Touch Red” lingers beneath wakefulness, slipping into nightmares with the introduction of a distorted guitar. At its most striking moments, Closer to Grey recognizes the importance of pushing at the edges of a tried-and-true sound.When Jewel’s arrangements become too austere and his songwriting falls back on the overly familiar, the album loses some of its charm. The basic synth melodies and deadpan vocal hooks of “Twist the Knife” are more anemic than even this terminally cool band can pull off. The title track is paint-by-numbers Chromatics—understandably so, since it’s at least four years old. Its palm-muted guitar plucks, 4/4 drum beat, and melancholic melodies don’t sound bad, or even past their prime—but they have little to offer an album that shines when experimenting. The glockenspiel and sweeping strings on lovelorn ballad “Move a Mountain” might feel slightly out of place, but at least they’re unexpected.As with much of Jewel’s work, Closer to Grey’s ultimate enemy is time itself. He’s not attempting to outrun it so much as wrestle it, trying to bend bygone eras to his will. The five years between Night Drive and Kill for Love resulted in music that transcended an already exemplary blueprint for chilly disco-pop; the next seven were building slowly towards a monumental statement. Then, out of the blue, Closer to Grey arrived with a note explaining that it represents the seventh Chromatics album, effectively turning Dear Tommy (the would-be sixth) into a “lost” record. The switch-up adds a fascinating page to the band’s ongoing mythology, but it also robs Closer to Grey of its own narrative. By the band’s own telling, the best Chromatics record is the one you’ve never heard.",2019-10-12,7.1
Lightning Bolt,Sonic Citadel,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","For 25 years now, Lightning Bolt has made a career out of indulging only the most gnarled riffs, covering every sound in brittle distortion, and playing live shows so loud and destructive that they—literally—blow out the power and leave the performers covered in blood. The duo’s dedication to this “move fast, break everything” mentality is still strong on Sonic Citadel, their seventh full-length album. The first song is called “Blow to the Head,” a three-minute blast of punishing kick drum, acrid bass riffs, and squealed vocals like a pile of styrofoam plates tossed on a bonfire. It’s as wonderfully ugly as anything they’ve ever made.They keep up this energy—standouts include the surreal anthems  “Bouncy House” and the Tilt-a-Whirl hardcore of “Tom Thump”—adding a handful of tracks to the pantheon of Lightning Bolt jams designed to keep your local audiologist in business. But where Sonic Citadel really takes off is in the moments where they deviate hardest from their formula. Underneath all the fuzz, there’s always been pop sensibility at work; Lightning Bolt riffs have been catchy in their own warped way since Ride the Skies. But at points, they allow those instincts to come into startling focus.That’s telegraphed, in part, in some of the song titles, which reference Don Henley, Husker Dü, and Van Halen. None of these jams especially sound like classic rock or hair metal, but they are some of the most memorable moments in the band’s catalog. “Don Henley in the Park” is an especially notable curveball, built around overlapping bass riffs that sound like a Durutti Column song as played by the Tasmanian Devil. Chippendale’s nursery-rhyme vocals would almost be fit for a sing-along, if you could make out what he’s saying. (The lyric sheet isn’t especially helpful on this score; it reads “[improvised lyrics].”)The record’s last vocal track, “All Insane,” is among the more straightforward songs in the Lightning Bolt catalog. Gibson does away with the frills and flourishes that often accompany his bass work as Chippendale settles into a steady mid-tempo beat, singing passionately of living life while the living is good. It’s surprising, but not unprecedented: Somewhere in the flailing limbs and searing volume of Lightning Bolt’s music was a call to squeeze everything you can out a moment, to do whatever it takes to feel something and to do so for as long as you can.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-12,7.8
Pelada,Movimiento Para Cambio,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=electronic"">Electronic</a>","When Chris Vargas and Tobias Rochman first met as coworkers in a Montreal clothing shop, they clashed—“like oil and water,” Rochman says. But after Rochman’s solo project shared a bill with Vargas’ industrial band Pelvic Floor, something clicked. “We’re both strong-willed individuals,” says Rochman. “It’s better if we’re on the same side.” Together, as the duo Pelada, they fuse Rochman’s lithe house and techno productions with Vargas’ defiant Spanish-language vocals, sung-shouted in a thin yet forceful voice that cuts through the mix like broken glass. On Movimiento Para Cambio, their debut album, the duo’s opposing influences prove surprisingly complementary.Though punk and dance music make strange bedfellows, it’s not an unheard-of combination: The two styles commingled at the Mudd Club in the late 1970s, engendering a funk-punk fusion that, decades later, would bequeath DFA its founding aesthetic. And in the 1990s, Atari Teenage Riot grafted hardcore punk onto breakbeat hardcore, echoing the Prodigy’s snarling aggression. But the two traditions have rarely yielded a merger quite like this one. Rather than seeking overlap, Pelada exploit the disconnect between their respective backgrounds.On record, they still sound like oil and water. Vargas’ monotone shout is reedy and insistent, recalling hardcore punk’s classic declamatory style. Instead of responding with a correspondingly harsh sound, Rochman veers in the opposite direction, opting for velvety deep house descended from the lineage of Larry Heard. It’s an interesting proposition: Seduce listeners with reassuring sounds like the Korg M1 organ bass, a staple of ’90s dance pop, then shout them down like the singer at an all-ages hardcore matinee.The contrast is apparent on the opening song, “A Mí Me Juzgan Por Ser Mujer,” in which Vargas, who uses they/them pronouns, directs their fire at patriarchal instincts and male privilege—the “machitos” demanding more than they deserve. Stuttering chord stabs and breakbeats build to a surging, acid-fueled climax, but the quantized grid keeps the energy in check; Vargas’ chorus, on the other hand, drips with barely contained rage. “They judge me for being a woman/But I was born in this body,” they chant in Spanish, voice rising to a pointed shout; “I didn’t choose it and I don’t know what to do/This is out of my control.”Many of the album’s best songs are animated by this tension. In “Habla Tu Verdad” (“Speak Your Truth”), Vargas might just as well be standing at the front of a protest march, megaphone in hand, each chanted proclamation fit for a hand-lettered sign, while Rochman channels the brightly colored synth of Midwestern techno from the late 1990s. Sometimes, the two egg each other on. In “Desatado,” Vargas lies back, their voice flat and cool, while Rochmann builds the kind of bleepy, quick-stepping beat you might have heard from Aphex Twin’s Rephlex label in the 1990s. Then, as Vargas breaks into a shout, the music crescendos too, and the beat seems on the verge of pulling apart altogether.They have other modes: “Granadilla” is a kind of ambient spoken-word R&B, while “Caderona” fuses ’80s electro with reggaeton. Best of all might be the closing “Aquí,” an environmentalist anthem set to the lush chords of Balearic house. The mood is idyllic yet streaked with turbulence: As the steady beats cruise on, they snag and stumble; Vargas’ speaking voice, uncharacteristically placid, is periodically run through shuddering glitch effects. Throughout the album, questions of control are paramount: Who has it, and whom they wield it against. Here, Vargas declares in a matter-of-fact tone, “Nature controls us/Not vice versa,” and the song’s subtly fraught quality—lovely as a sunset, yet disturbed by a hidden undercurrent—feels like the duo’s way of acknowledging our fundamental vulnerability.",2019-10-12,6.9
Big Thief,Two Hands,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","Coming from a band who, just five months ago, materialized somewhere deep in a forest with a mystical set of songs wrapped in a vast, alien cosmos—a band who, in order to summon the perfect squall of noise, claimed to have suspended an electric guitar from the ceiling of a barn and batted it around like a piñata in a circle of amplifiers—Two Hands is jarringly earthbound. For their latest album, the Brooklyn quartet Big Thief invites you to join them live and unadorned in the studio for the span of 10 songs. “Hand me that cable/Plug into anything,” Adrianne Lenker sings, moments after issuing a more basic instruction: “Cry with me/Cry with me.”Nearly every song overflows with tears and blood, bared teeth and broken tongues; living, killing, dying. There are few overdubs, and sometimes you hear the band members instructing each other when to step back or take a solo, like they’re just rehearsing for the actual performance. It makes for a specific kind of rock record: an attempt to capture a band’s imperfect, raw essence, to show what happens when they simply count to four and take off. The approach is best known for accentuating a tough, ragged cohesion, like Neil Young records in the ’70s, but this record goes somewhere different. The more Big Thief zoom in, the more magical they sound.It’s a trick that these musicians have spent their careers perfecting. Since their 2016 debut, Masterpiece, each successive album has felt like a breakthrough geared for larger spaces. But their own interpersonal dynamic has followed an inverse trajectory. “At this point we’re basically touching each other,” guitarist Buck Meek recently observed about their magnetic live shows, a connection made literal on the new album cover. After the spacious odes to the natural world on U.F.O.F, Two Hands is a record defined by these collisions—a reminder that intimacy isn’t just about the comfort we bring to each other but also the proximity to our sickness and pain, blood and guts.The record proceeds along a bell-curve, with the heavier moments at the center reverberating through the quieter points on either end. The focus is on the patient interplay between Lenker’s guitar—rhythmic and physical, like a slot machine with infinite outcomes—and James Krivchenia’s drumming, as patient and instinctive as it’s ever sounded. The accompaniment from Meek and bassist Max Oleartchik, who plays a few solos in “Those Girls,” is more understated but just as crucial. In sparer, creeping moments like “The Toy” and “Cut My Hair,” you can sense the band listening to each other, responding with reassuring hums and nods. And when they do cut loose, you feel the thrashing.Variations on the word “crying” appear in half these songs, and each time Lenker sings it, she tells a different story. Occasionally her lonesome, quivering voice feels like an outsider descendent of country-folk singers like Kath Bloom or Iris DeMent, particularly in “Replaced,” a co-write with Meek. Other times, she sounds like someone clawing at her own skin, trying to escape. In “Forgotten Eyes,” a heartland rocker whose lyrics might be about homelessness, she trembles uneasily toward the final chorus, holding out the “ng” of “tongue” until it makes a phlegmy, growling noise in the back of her throat. Big Thief were built for moments like these, where sound merges with meaning, where the floating voice in your headphones finds its body.As a lyricist, Lenker has become newly adept at telling stories through her absences. She’s written songs in the past that dazzle with poetry (“Mary”) and others that are memoiristic in their precision (“Mythological Beauty”), but these are pared down to just the most crucial bits of dialogue and wisdom. “Everybody needs a home and deserves protection,” she sings in “Forgotten Eyes,” her voice breaking at the word “needs.” “Talk to the boy in me/He’s there,” she begs in the closing “Cut My Hair” as the music cuts out from underneath her. Best of all is “Not,” a fiery exorcism that merges some of her most explosive imagery with a climactic guitar solo; the desperation in her playing feels like a string of cries interrupted by shallow, gasping breaths.“Not” sits at the heart of the record with “Shoulders,” a stunner that’s been in the band’s live repertoire for years. Like a dark analog to Bruce Springsteen’s “The Promised Land” or the Mountain Goats’ “This Year,” it gains power from its folk simplicity: a plaintive melody and a chorus that snowballs with a momentum that seems physical—part promise, part prayer. Lenker, who once noted that she is often both the attacker and prey in her own songwriting, finds its gospel not by rising above her circumstances but through succumbing to her complicity. “The blood of the man who’s killing our mother with his hands is in me,” she sings. “It’s in me/In my veins.” Her voice sounds genuinely desperate, anguished, like she would rid herself of it if she could.The version of “Shoulders” on Two Hands is the definitive take, though you can see its spirit in every live performance. During one particularly great video from Philadelphia’s Johnny Brenda’s in 2017, Lenker’s guitar cuts out during the first chorus. She takes it off and, for the rest of the song, is just a singer: pulling the microphone from the stand, closing her eyes, and doubling over as if in pain to deliver the second verse. Instead of picking up her guitar part, Lenker’s bandmates only highlight her absence, drawing your attention to the new void at the song’s core. By the end, all that’s left is Krivchenia’s steady drumbeat and Lenker front and center, sort of jogging in place, as everyone in the room holds their breath. It’s a random technical issue but it’s also a chance for Big Thief to pose their favorite kinds of challenges. How much can we strip away without losing our essence? What happens when our most basic modes of expression fail us? How will we carry on together? On Two Hands, they are unstoppable.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-11,9.0
Lindstrøm,On a Clear Day I Can See You Forever,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=electronic"">Electronic</a>","Robert Moog’s mid-century, tinker-friendly analog synthesizers were originally “hammered out in the pub” and “assembled out of junk,” write Trevor Pinch and Frank Trocco in Analogue Days: The Invention and Impact of the Moog Synthesizer. The dream was to make sounds like nothing else on Earth, which could be then be made by absolutely anyone on Earth.But by the 1980s, the dream was fading. Moog’s instruments were, in the end, whimsical and unwieldy. Bigger companies made simpler, more powerful machines. The Memorymoog, in 1982, would be the last thing Moog made for decades, and it was a polyphonic powerhouse. But it lacked touch sensitivity, which meant it basically just played loud, and its presets varied wildly; users switching from machine to machine had to pray the strings didn’t sound like brass. In a Hail Mary pass to stay solvent, Moog salesman David Van Koevering, a former evangelical preacher, repackaged a hundred or so unsold models as “Sanctuary Synthesizers,” added a bunch of pious patches, and sold the lot to Christian music makers. Bankruptcy still arrived.Then a cult arose around these wooden boxes of wires. Devotees turned the Moog, like relics of the houses of Korg, ARP, and Roland, into a status symbol. Original Moogs are now incredibly expensive, both in terms of cost and the time it takes to learn to use and maintain them. They look great among the fiddle-leaf fig trees on your frenemy’s feed. They are fetish objects at last, prized more for what they are than what they can do.None of this is Hans-Peter Lindstrøm’s fault. Over the course of his 16-year-career he’s floated to the front of the third-wave analog revival, lifting the wow and flutter of predecessors like Stereolab and Faze Action and sending them into a Scandinavian disco jam-band dimension. Tracks like “Closing Shot,” “Blinded by the LEDs,” and of course the deathless “I Feel Space” demonstrated a command of form and function. Clearly he’s mastered his machinery: On a Clear Day I Can See You Forever arrives in the wake of his performance at Henie Onstad Kunstsenter, commissioned on the occasion of the art space’s 50th anniversary and conscripting untold riches to procure some 30 hard-to-source synthesizers and drum machines.One of them, a Memorymoog, as it happens, forms the foundation of the new album’s title track. He dusted one off and explored what he could do with it in 10 minutes, then played it back in reverse while improvising on the Fender Rhodes; a little perfuming with a Hammond through a wah-wah and some spring-reverbs, and, well, the sum of the parts is the sum of the track. The genius of, for example, those old Boards of Canada interludes was how they dissipated before their mystery ran out. “On a Clear Day I Can See You Forever” instead hopes for meaning through repetition, exploiting the precariousness of its electrical pulses as they stream through metal effects units. A rumble about eight minutes in scared the devil out of my cats, but soon enough they were snoring again in a puddle of sun.The second track, “Really Deep Snow,” is anchored by a covetable Roland SH-101 and administered by various ARPs, Korgs, and Wurlitzers. It’s another almost 10-minute improv, whose main chords pay tribute to a psalm Lindstrøm heard in church as a child. Its vibe is certainly more Halloween (2018), though, a reincarnation of unholy terror as the anxiety of influence. John Carpenter was, without a doubt, the patron saint of arpeggiated epics; “Really Deep Snow” is a pious tribute, if one is needed.Which can’t be said of the third track, titled by a lousy joke that feels, well, profane. How about we not appropriate the sacrament of an African American spiritual promising biblical deliverance from slavery in the service of a hardware pun? How about we not “Swing Low, Sweet LFO,” with its plinky Pianet and sugary Prophet 6 sweeps, less offensive than Moby’s appropriation of spirituals for car commercials but also, unfortunately, very much not as memorable?Still, as in Christianity, redemption comes in the end. “As If No One Is Here” reincarnates a tone poem by Jean Sibelius, itself based on the Finnish national epic Kalevala, which tells the story of a swan being hunted in the realm of the dead. And that’s exactly what it sounds like: a murky suspension of endangered grace. A Roland TR-77 drips like water off stalactites into pools of Yamaha CS-60 chords, deeper than they first appear. Halfway through, acoustic cello and violin cut through like slits of moonlight and everything stills without settling down. Korg MS20 and ARP Solina Strings summon grimmer harmonies. There are echoes of Eno and Badalamenti, though “As If No One Is Here” feels looser than either would allow; perhaps Lindstrøm is better at mixing inspiration than at improvisation new forms.Nonetheless, in moments, On a Clear Day I Can See You Forever is proof that there’s reason to have faith in these elite objects, these inventions of the dead that still somehow call out to us. Ignore the yuppie collectors who think that owning something improves their worth, or that hoarding these rarities will somehow save them from the grave. Lindstrøm may have timed these tracks to fit on a vinyl record, another sign of putting material concerns over creative vision, but there’s a good 15 minutes of so of beauty within those grooves that just might make a believer out of you.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-11,6.6
Bill Orcutt,Odds Against Tomorrow,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=experimental"">Experimental</a>","Malleability is built into the character of American traditional music. Rooted in oral storytelling, foundational songs like the “Battle Hymn of the Republic” and “Oh Shenandoah” have been known by several names and attached to various meanings and ideologies over the decades. The former has had multiple lives since it emerged as a popular tune in the mid 1800s: Pete Seeger anthemized it as “Solidarity Forever,” which guitarist Bill Orcutt recorded on his 2013 album A History of Every One, offering one of the most radical takes on the melody in its nearly two-century lifespan. Orcutt takes the elasticity inherent in folk music and augments it with avant-garde jazz and free improvisation, two other distinctly American forms. A dialogue between these traditions has formed the basis of Orcutt’s solo albums over the past decade, as he has recorded lacerated versions of “Star Spangled Banner,” “Nearer My God to Thee,” “Black Betty,” and other well-worn songs.Odds Against Tomorrow, Orcutt’s latest solo LP, steps away from overt renditions of popular melodies and returns to a subtler investigation of folk and blues. The raw melancholy lurking in the shadows of recordings by pioneers like Son House, Blind Lemon Jefferson, and Charley Patton also hangs heavy over Orcutt’s original compositions. On his early solo releases, most notably A New Way to Pay Old Debts, from 2009, and the follow-up EP Way Down South, his mournful themes were punctuated by spasms of pentatonic runs and extemporaneous howling, giving the music a wild, unrestrained nature. By contrast, Orcutt’s playing on Odds Against Tomorrow is notably restrained and frequently threatens beauty. While earlier LPs felt like spontaneous outpourings, this album feels worked over, informed by lessons learned from the iconic composers he has spent the past half-decade recontextualizing.One of the most notable indicators of this approach is Orcutt’s use of multitracking on three songs, a first in his solo career. On the title track, he traces an understated chord progression in the left channel, allowing the song’s fractured melodic line to dissolve and reconstitute itself in the right, peaking in a wailing, single-note outburst. Rather than boxing the songs into a distinctive harmonic path, the technique allows Orcutt to indulge in more intricately crafted solos, dexterously flying up and down the neck of his four-string electric guitar. If his early work channeled Ornette Coleman in its ability to imply complex changes without their constant, explicit presence, this new technique brings him closer to the conventional electric blues pantheon.Despite these increasingly polyphonic excursions, Odds Against Tomorrow is defined largely by a considered quietude. The one cover on the album, an arrangement of Henry Mancini’s “Moon River,” feels enveloped by negative space, serenely picked with a slight tremolo effect. Album closer “Man Dies” is two minutes of a sentimental, unadorned melody that ends with the buzz of an amplifier decaying into nothingness. Orcutt’s slow transformation from antagonistic abstractionist to wistful minimalist has had many detours, and he continues to explore torrential exuberance in his collaborative work, especially with free-jazz drummer Chris Corsano. But on Odds Against Tomorrow he has found a way to settle down without settling into complacency. The album retains the core elements of his best work, and his restless, postmodern exploration of the American lexicon, while refining what makes those qualities potent. Refusing to repeat himself, he takes tradition as a living thing, blazing new trails to familiar vistas.",2019-10-11,7.8
billy woods,Terror Management,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rap"">Rap</a>","Terror Management begins with a clip of Kurt Vonnegut explaining narrative arcs. The most common story structure, he argues, is “man in a hole,” which he breaks down as “somebody gets into trouble, gets out of it again.” Vonnegut’s audience laughs, but in billy woods’ world, holes tend to be bottomless. His last album was March’s hiding places, a record set in crawl spaces and crags where men in holes settle into the sediment instead of plotting escape. Terror Management, written immediately after hiding places, doubles down on that fatalism, sinking into the darkness at the bottom of the well.The album’s cover is a jagged ice plain with a fleck of a sun in the distant horizon, and woods channels that sense of chilled abandonment throughout the record, finding misery everywhere he looks: cancelled Christmases, dead spiders stuck in webs, splintered glaciers. The imagery is crisp but plotless; instead of characters, woods offers landscapes. “The sky empty, trees like widows huddled/The bore muzzle nuzzle, iridescent black truffle/Black snow in the forest,” he raps on “Shepherd’s Tone” He sounds like he’s narrating satellite footage.That sense of dreadful stillness is amplified by the production, which is often tenuously connected to the writing. On “Gas Leak” a blast wave of distortion detonates in the middle of the song, presumably dramatizing the title but also disrupting the momentum. On “Blood Thinner,” hisses and crackles sizzle in the foreground at a steady clip. woods is clearly trying to evoke tension and paranoia, but the result too often feels cluttered and airless.The record catches steam around the midway point, where woods taps into the sentiments behind his obsession with bleakness. His freeform, street-preacher flow works wonders on “Birdsong,” winding into volleys of gut punches. “First time he saw the word nigga in a book/How it danced on the page/Back in the day/It’s what the family didn't say/How you knew it was AIDS,” he raps. “Trivial Pursuit” turns Open Mike Eagle’s album Rappers Will Die of Natural Causes into a funny conspiracy: “Rappers dying in they sleep/I’m watching Mike Eagle on TV/It ain’t just luck, chief.” Moments like these are reminders that the miseries and absurdities of the late capitalist hellscape are sensory and personal. The abyss is an experience, not just a setting.Album highlight “Great Fires” centers on the permanence of a breakup, presumably woods’ divorce. woods is oblique throughout, never citing a decisive scene of rupture, but never disputing that the relationship was doomed. “Sleep a steep fall, wake up like a stray dog/You wonder where she found the strength not to call/You’re proud of her, you know what it cost,” he laments, stuck in the aftermath. Built around a tinny horn loop and dusty drums, the song swells to a despondent utterance of the former lover’s name that’s jaggedly overdubbed with the word “love.” The insertion sucks the wind out of woods and lays bare the kinds of losses he sees in the desolation he’s so intent on cataloging.In 2013 billy woods described himself as the bridge between late Zimbabwean novelist Dambudzo Marechera and Earl Sweatshirt. There was a defiant pride in that claim, a conviction that despite Marechera’s death from AIDS in the ’80s, and woods’ obscurity, the lineage of artful African perspectives on Western terrors would persist. In 2019 Marechera is still dead, the Klan is active in Kurt Vonnegut’s native Indiana, and Earl regularly tweets billy woods lyrics. The world is absolutely the shitshow woods knows it to be, but even the apocalypse has its charms.",2019-10-11,6.5
that dog.,Old LP,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","In their ’90s heyday, that dog. existed in between two major pillars of alt-rock: Grungy, bemusedly annoyed rock and zingy, precisely detailed alt-pop. An L.A. band whose pedigree included music-biz royalty—lead singer and songwriter Anna Waronker is the daughter of label exec Lenny Waronker, while sisters Rachel and Petra Haden, who provided backing vocals and instrumentals, are children of jazz bassist Charlie Haden—they developed a fierce following from the periphery of alt-rock radio, which had already begun to sideline fun (and female voices) in favor of self-pity by the time the group broke up in 1997.that dog. got back together in 2011 as a four-piece, along with drummer Tony Maxwell. Playing their songs—particularly those that they hadn’t played live before—energized Waronker, whose hiatus years included a rock opera co-written with Go-Go Charlotte Caffey, music for TV, and two solo albums, to return to the spiky, elegant mode of her onetime band.What’s remarkable about Old LP, that dog.’s first album since their split and their first as a trio (Petra left after the reunion shows), is how little time seems to have elapsed. The harmonies still have gooey centers; the fuzzed-out guitars and precisely arranged strings still bounce off each other like highly attuned dancers. Compact and thoughtful—the band worked on the album for years—Old LP has the vibe of a beloved record that was, for whatever reason, sitting on a shelf.The album opens with “Your Machine,” a showcase for Waronker’s plaintive vocals that crests into a full-on power-pop starburst, as distortion-heavy riffs rise up to counter her pleas for notice. “I am incomplete/Impatiently/Awaiting your receipt/And graciously/Eating crumbs thrown at my feet,” goes one lyric, a poetic echo of the “thanks for your support!” messages issued by artists in the era of online patronage. When the noise eventually recedes, allowing Waronker and the harmonies behind her to rise up, it’s a moment of pop triumph.From there, that dog. balance beauty and muck, with marshmallow-sweet vocals and careening strings adding tension to the breakneck chorus of “Just the Way” and the weepy violins of “Drip Drops” filling out the lyrics’ minimalistic portrayal of heartbreak. “If You Just Didn’t Do It” sounds excavated from a lost volume of DGC Rarities, with a shimmying beat and defiant, closing string flourish that offer a subtle update of ’90s alt-rock’s satisfying bite.Like much of the best 2019 music from still-at-it ’90s alt-rockers—Juliana Hatfield, Versus, Team Dresch—Old LP works because its growth doesn’t pander to modern notions of “cool.” But the way the band re-balances the grime-vs.-grandiosity equation with each song demonstrates that when it comes to musical math, the proof matters as much as the outcome. The title track, which closes the album, isn’t just a sweet elegy to music’s power to conjure bittersweet memories. “I never wanted you to leave/I hate that there’s no choice/That I can’t hear your voice/Unless it’s on an old LP,” go the lyrics, which were written after a memorial service for Charlie Haden. It’s the first time Waronker and Rachel Haden have sung a duet on record, their voices darting in and out of each other while cymbals crash and strings swoon. Looking back, which Old LP does with gentleness and honesty, doesn’t have to be a nostalgia trap.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-10,7.4
Taking Back Sunday,Tell All Your Friends,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","If there was ever a visual metaphor for emo’s second wave, it’s a gang of women in tank tops kicking the shit out of a skinny white guy. That iconic image, a flip of David Fincher’s Fight Club from the video for Taking Back Sunday’s “Cute Without the E (Cut From the Team),” broadly symbolizes a wave of early ‘00s bands who’d been downhearted and used pop and post-hardcore to expose their freshly picked scabs. But the video’s scene was also on-the-nose to the point of being camp, marking the divergent path that Taking Back Sunday took from their peers. Their music described all the ways of being an emotional punching bag even as it sent up bleeding-heart stereotypes. The balance between wit and sincerity courses through their newly-remastered, still gripping debut, 2002’s Tell All Your Friends.Taking Back Sunday’s members came from the kind of suburban towns that have a way of magnifying anxiety, isolation, and paranoia into high-stakes urgency. In 1999, the five-piece formed in Amityville, New York, leading their then-label Victory Records to proclaim that “a city that has been synonymous with nothing but horror since the 1979 release of The Amityville Horror is about to be redefined.” But given the near-universal concerns of their landmark debut Tell All Your Friends—heartbreak, jealousy, and depression, elevated to an operatic intensity—the five-piece could have come from just about any out-of-the-way place in the U.S. The stretch of grey highway depicted on the cover of their debut album Tell All Your Friends is about as region-specific as a McDonald’s.Their sound, though, had tell-tale antecedents in Long Island’s thriving late-’90s punk scene and post-hardcore across the nation. The hooks of the Get Up Kids, the intensity of Thursday, and the post-rockish flourishes of Cap’n Jazz come together in Taking Back Sunday’s taut, poppy anthems, while also leaving a breadcrumb trail for fans to go deeper into the genre. Guitarist Eddie Reyes had played in bands including the Movielife, and the call-and-response vocals of another former band, Clockwise, inspired Adam Lazzara and John Nolan’s fevered duels.On Tell All Your Friends, every instrument pushes against each other. Frontman Adam Lazzara—a microphone masochist with the swooping hair of a Funko Pop! figurine—delivers the album’s opening lines as if he’s been waiting his whole life to do it. “So sick so sick of being tired, and oh so tired of being sick.” Later, a chorus-slash-manifesto arrives alongside guitars that hit like an electrical current’s surge. “We won’t stand for hazy eyes anymore.” It’s a sublime bit of chest-puffing nonsense, a stake in the ground that’s twisted until it holds fast.The psyche of young, white, cis straight men is dissected with startling candor. “Ghost Man on Third” is a brutally vivid chronicle of addiction and suicidal ideation, on which Lazzara wrenchingly repeats the line, “It’s a shame I don’t think that they’ll notice.” Meanwhile, “Bike Scene,” with gorgeous backing vocals from Nolan’s sister Michelle DaRosa, fits in a hundred hooks while it evokes post-heartbreak depression. “The Blue Channel” takes a sleazy riff and soaks it in screams, before Lazzara’s taunting whisper at the song’s close: “Do you know what your girl’s been up to?”At times like this, author Jessica Hopper’s description of women in emo songs comes to mind. They are, she wrote in a 2003 essay, “denied the dignity of humanization through both the language and narratives [...] only of consequence in romantic settings.” It’s hard to deny this read of Tell All Your Friends’ lyrics. But the band knowingly play into emo’s tropes—by 2002, already well-worn—with a knowing wink. Women are addressed as “sweetie” and “princess,” terms that endow their songs the satirical register of screwball comedy. You can imagine Cary Grant delivering a quip like “Cute Without the E”’s “don’t bother, angel,” through a plume of cigarette smoke. And “You’re So Last Summer”’s unforgettable line—“You could slit my throat/And with my one last gasping breath I’d apologize for bleeding on your shirt”—is both achingly real and downright absurd, a humorous quality hammered home by Flava Flav’s bizarre lip-sync to the lines in the song’s video.In a 2003 Absolute Punk interview, Nolan explained his and Lazzara’s psychodramatic reenactments of a straight couple’s dialogue in their music: “Me and Adam had an idea originally to have some of the lyrics written like a play where one line is the boy and the next line is the girl,” he said. This fluidity, coupled with Lazzara’s slash fic-catalyzing hangouts with other emo frontmen, allows for delightfully queer readings of songs like “You’re So Last Summer,” on which Lazzara belts, “These grass stains on my knees they don’t mean a thing.” (He’s recounting the speech of a woman. But he’s still the one saying it.) Taking Back Sunday’s innate flamboyance, coupled with their songs’ willful slippage of gender binaries, makes them a complicating outlier in a largely straight scene which privileged cis male voices even as their lyrics ultimately upheld its supportive pillars.Even so, the most compelling relationship cataloged in Tell All Your Friends is the flame war between Taking Back Sunday and Brand New’s Jesse Lacey (2017 reports alleged that Lacey is a sexual abuser and pedophile). A former member of the band, Lacey was allegedly kicked out of Taking Back Sunday after romancing Nolan’s girlfriend, and responded with 2001’s cruelly catchy DUI fantasy, “Seventy Times 7.” The Amityville band turned Lacey’s words against him in the math-y anthem “There’s No ‘I’ in Team,” but everyone involved seemed to revel in the drama; the bands came together to perform a mash-up of the two songs a few months after Tell All Your Friends’ release. Real-life context seemed to undermine any real threat of lyrics like “best friends means I pulled the trigger,” stoking the mythos of both groups. Adding credence to the theory that the rivalry was only skin deep, you could buy the Team Brand New or Team Taking Back Sunday shirt.Unbeknownst to the band members who made the album while just grazing legal drinking age, Tell All Your Friends was a pivot point for second-wave emo. The genre exploded in late 2004 and into 2005 as Fall Out Boy and My Chemical Romance became TRL staples and Taking Back Sunday’s second album, 2004’s Where You Want to Be, sold 163,000 copies in its first week, a staggering number even in the CD era. But Tell All Your Friends still stands for being young, being horny, being a troll. It was a high-water mark at a moment just before everything changed.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-10,8.0
The Menzingers,Hello Exile,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","The Menzingers write about basically one thing, though contrary to this tweet, it’s not the waitress outside the all-night diner. The seven-year span from their second LP Chamberlain Waits to 2017’s After the Party is a longitudinal study of men in their 20s struggling to process the passage of time, drinking away the tragicomic pain of reliving the good ol’ days that never happened. Imagine “Glory Days” if it was just the third verse, the high-school jocks and heartbreakers replaced by guys in dumpy vans and stalled relationships wishing they committed themselves to something more substantial—or as “House on Fire” put it, “waiting for your life to start, then you die.” After the Party occasionally gave the impression that the Menzingers recognized this form of nostalgia as an artistic dead end, posing “Where we gonna go now that our 20s are over?” as an existential crisis. Instead, Hello Exile reframes it as a question with a single, obvious answer: They’re gonna go right back to making Menzingers songs about getting older.“How do I steer my early 30s/Before I shipwreck, before I’m 40,” Greg Barnett announces at the outset, and despite the parallels to the aforementioned line from After the Party opener “Tellin’ Lies,” the intention is different—there’s an unexpected optimism amidst the pervasive societal turmoil of “America (You’re Freaking Me Out),” a willingness to see a wasted 20s as a dry run for responsible adulthood instead of a sunk cost or an endlessly renewable resource for self-loathing. Like most bands in their position, Menzingers commit to living in the moment by proclaiming “we do politics now.” While the title of “Strawberry Mansion” would usually promise yet another hardscrabble account of drinking Keystone Light in the Keystone State, this time, the Menzingers describe the impending environmental apocalypse in the same language as “Born to Run” (“Set a course for the sun/To bittersweet oblivion”).And while none of Barnett’s insights on “America (You’re Freaking Me Out)” are remotely original—“What kind of monsters did our parents vote for?”; “Cranks for Christians in powerful positions/I’ve always felt like all their pomp and circumstance is just cover for the devil to dance”; “Can’t you recognize truth from clever lies?”— they paint a sympathetic and empathetic portrait. Menzingers’ narrators aren’t radicals, and neither are the Menzingers; their musical progressions are incremental and headed towards predictable outcomes. The slower songs are a little bit more country, the more uptempo ones a bit more rootsy, and all of it is bolstered by typically brawny Will Yip production that cuts through the chatter of any barroom or basement.Since they perfected their craft with On the Impossible Past, the boundary between Menzingers songs and parodic “Menzingers songs” has all but disappeared, undermining their heartfelt honesty with bingo cards of burly, sensitive-rock-guy tropes seen through Pabst-colored lenses. “I was getting fucked up with a high school friend/Wondering where all the good times went”; “I know what you’re thinking but I can’t stop drinking”; those used to be the subtexts of Menzingers songs, but now they’re choruses on songs literally called “High School Friend” and “I Can’t Stop Drinking.”  The plot to “Anna” is quintessential “Menzingers”—a guy starts to realize his girlfriend’s outgrowing him (“It’s like our studio apartment is just a place to keep your stuff”) and can’t summon the confidence to make up the ground between them. Instead, he begs her “please come back to Philadelphia” so they can relive their first days living together, dancing in the kitchen and “drinking cheap red wine.”As it is in many Menzingers songs (scare quotes or otherwise), “cheap” is an important qualifier, one that cuts against Anna’s job promotion and newfound upward mobility. While people might not ever face abject poverty in a Menzingers song, they’re always one squandered paycheck or shitty tour away from couch-surfing for the next year. But throughout Hello Exile, “cheap” ends up exposing a poverty of new ideas: Barnett wants to rekindle a relationship on “Portland” with “cheap Champagne and roses”; he swears this “cheap motel” is temporary on “Strain Your Memory,” even though you’ll find him plastered off “cheap beer” in “I Can’t Stop Drinking,” and when everyone comes together in a “Farewell Youth,” they’re “drinking the cheap stuff.” “Farewell youth, I hardly got to know you,” Barnett sings, but even though they get older, “Menzingers songs” remain the same.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-10,5.8
Gong Gong Gong 工工工,Phantom Rhythm 幽靈節奏 (幽霊リズム),"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","A couple of misfits and a brash bouquet of sound: These are the building blocks from which rock’n’roll sprang. Beijing-based Gong Gong Gong slot directly into the canon—the streamlined duo of Tom Ng and Joshua Frank use two of the most familiar instruments in the rock pantheon, a rhythm guitar and a bass, to create Phantom Rhythm 幽靈節奏. The result is a novel pastiche of post-punk, West African blues, Bo Diddley, and distortion.Ng and Frank started playing together in 2015 under their adopted city’s underpasses and in DIY spaces. Even with crisp production, this record (their first, after 2018’s Siren 7"") indicates a pair capable of holding its own in a repurposed warehouse or shipping crate. Their divergent backgrounds—Ng grew up in Hong Kong, and Montreal-born Frank has lived in Beijing off and on since childhood—yields a complementary chemistry. Adding drums or keys would be an intrusion. Gong Gong Gong stack garage instrumentation, Ali Farka Touré melodies, and dissonance without a whiff of the baroque. Opener “The Last Note” casts an ominous, unrelenting spell, building steadily towards Ng’s deadpan Cantonese intonations. It’s a refusal to capitulate on multiple fronts—language, fervor, unnecessary flourishes. By minute four, the fervent, interwoven riffs evoke the sinews of a charging beast.The album reaches its zenith midway through, where standouts “Wei Wei Wei” and “Some Kind of Demon” follow in succession. These songs follow a similar structure as most others—an insistent, galloping rhythm overlaid with guttural cries and a sinuous riff. “Wei Wei Wei”’s opening fuzz leads into a faux-casual plod, charting a steady ascent into rhythmic abandon, order teasing at chaos. It’s music that engages one’s entire body. “It’s a pity/As long as/Can only/But not/Still,” Ng yelps on “Some Kind of Demon,” the choked lyrics in direct opposition to the music’s metronomic swagger.In its spareness and meticulousness, Phantom Rhythm 幽靈節奏 leaves so little room for missteps that every reverberation proves to be an act of curation and collaboration. If there’s a critique to be made here, it’s that some tracks (“Moonshadows,” for instance) pale in comparison to their freakier counterparts, whose jazzy rhythms elevate them beyond their component parts. Even so, Ng’s screech in the second half of “Moonshadows” is a fork stuck into a live outlet. At their best, Gong Gong Gong point towards a future where (porous) borders and a vast palette of influences facilitate interesting collaboration. When they’re plugged in, driving towards a chorus or bridge, they sound like an engine of revelation.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-10,7.6
Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds,Ghosteen,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","On the sublime Ghosteen—the first album Nick Cave has written and recorded entirely since the death of his teenage son, Arthur, in 2015—he sorts through his grief and all the requisite stages, occasionally as though in real time. His mood drifts between domesticity and depravity. He empathizes with the true believers who wept beneath Jesus’ feet at the crucifixion. He latches onto friendship and love in any shape they take. He loses his faith, then fights desperately for any belief that can replace it. Scored by synthesizers, pianos, and electronics, the process is alternately harrowing and comforting for the first hour of the album, Cave’s waking nightmare on full display.But then, in the album’s final verse, at the close of the dangerous “Hollywood,” he steps back from the edge of a nervous collapse to paraphrase a Buddhist parable in his fractured falsetto: “Kisa had a baby, but the baby died,” he sings. And so begins “The Mustard Seed,” a tale in which a mourning mother, Kisa Gotami, tries to save her baby by asking for seeds from houses where no one has died, as prescribed by the Buddha. Alas, someone has already died in every other house, so Kisa is left to bury her child and manage another home where the specter of death has crept across the threshold. “It’s a long way to go to find peace of mind,” Cave repeats at the end, the bassline’s tension and his wounded tone emphasizing the cold irony of the epiphany. Still, the takeaway is clear: He has not been alone in his sadness, and neither will you when the time comes.A little more than a year had passed since Arthur’s death when Cave released Skeleton Tree, a masterful record that, like the best of his catalog, used our mortality as way of considering what matters most. Hearing it as anything other than a response to the recent tragedy seemed nearly impossible. But the accident only informed Skeleton Tree, a new solemnity settling over the songs like morning mist.Ghosteen, however, squares up to the aftermath and to feelings of loss so overwhelming that Cave—“a man mad with grief”—questions the foundations of his sanity. There are moments where he nearly comes apart, holding himself together only by denying that death is final and believing that, maybe on the next train, his child will return. But he slowly wrestles hope from that existential abyss. Cave does not sublimate tragedy into triumph; he simply finds assurance in the knowledge that we’ve all walked through some sort of hell. That realization is the core of what may be the most poignant album of his storied career.Though Cave has long stood at the edge of darkness and tried to document what he felt there, writing about his family’s own tragedy proved vexing. His new songs didn’t ferry adequate emotional weight, he confided in The Guardian, and the singer who had once contextualized a convict’s trip to the electric chair as a sinner’s visit to confession had tired of the disingenuous tidiness of narrative. Soon, though, he found himself “amassing a stockpile of lines and thoughts, images and ideas,” forsaking his traditional sense of song for an atmosphere of intuition and feeling.That’s where we find him on Ghosteen, sorting through sensations of despair and persistence. Cave has cryptically said that the songs on Ghosteen’s first half are the children, while the interwoven triptych that follows are their parents. Those final three pieces are discursive and raw, pulling the broad emotional sweep of grief into a series of overstuffed settings. During “Ghosteen,” Cave counterbalances the wonder of being alive at all—broadcast over a sudden surge of strings and the record’s only cavalcade of drums—with the pedestrian cruelty of washing his dead child’s clothes or realizing almost absentmindedly that his family is now smaller. And “Hollywood” begins with seething rage, Cave looking to lash out at anything within reach, to hold even nature itself responsible for his loss while he waits for his own death. In the end, he relays the fable of Kisa, calming his nerves not with the company of others’ misery but with the wisdom that our sadness is but a point on an ancient timeline.The eight “children” are filtered and discrete, each investigating another side of what it means to bear the unbearable. Cave slips through phases of nostalgia and fantasy, fragments of lullabies and vows of love. He realizes that his art will outlive his body during opener “Spinning Song,” a surrealist rumination on Elvis and Priscilla Presley and their downfall. Cave and his wife, model and fashion designer Susie Bick, navigate their mindsets differently during “Waiting for You.” She wants to confront the truth and stare down reality, while he seeks refuge by longing for an ecclesiastic miracle—if an entire religion can rest on a belief in resurrection and afterlife, cannot fatherhood? Both are reasonable, he concludes, crooning, “Just want to stay in the business of making you happy.” Cave returns to the shores of compromise, finding safety in companionship.Likewise, the gorgeous “Bright Horses” opens inside a realm of imaginary terror, where horses dash through cities with their manes ablaze. He holds someone’s hand, protecting them from the fires. Even when that alternate world crumbles to reveal a swath of sociopolitical failure, he seeks some hypothetical redemption, some future brighter than his present. “Everyone has a heart, and it’s calling for something/And we’re all so sick and tired of seeing things as they are,” he deadpans in a stunning moment of functional escapism, reminding us that it’s OK to dream of the world we want, not the one we inherited. It’s impossible not to pull for him, to believe in his belief.As listeners, we mostly hover alongside Cave, floating in a middle distance shaped by Warren Ellis’ sprawling synthesizers and gilded by elegiac piano and scrambled samples, like signals dispatched from the great beyond. The Bad Seeds have long been a mighty rock band, prowling the darkened corners of the blues and the avant-garde. But they bend completely to Cave’s will here, not receding in the background so much as framing his self-portraits. This is the most musically esoteric record they’ve ever made, suspended somewhere between the urgent but obtuse abstraction of Current 93’s Black Ships Ate the Sky and the charged soundscapes of Harmonia. Their restraint strips away all emotional armaments, placing each of Cave’s vulnerabilities at the record’s humming surface. Cave doesn’t blink.Though secondary to the script, the production is sophisticated and subtle, often augmenting Cave’s words with shades of feeling and meaning he’s omitted from his text. There’s the chiming church bell that keeps the rhythm of “Night Raid,” a half-spoken recollection of Cave’s family gathered in a hotel room, laughing and leaning from the window to take in the streetscape below. The bell’s sound is initially warm and round, a signifier of the bustling city. But by song’s end, it arrives harder and faster, like a beeping alarm clock. It is a warning dispatched from the future, a damning promise that this happiness will end.Or there’s the choir that echoes his aspirational words during “Galleon Ship,” a song about committing to love, although you know it’s bound to bring pain. The voices are phased between the channels, surrounding Cave so that their pronouncements arrive at different times. The effect is vertiginous and disorienting, just as setting yourself up for hurt can be. The sound is so beautiful, though, you reckon it must be worth the risk.Ghosteen marks the 40th anniversary of Nick Cave’s recording career, a span that’s especially daunting considering that he has rarely released a clunker. For the uninitiated, it can seem intimidating to tap into new music by this kind of legacy artist, to dive into a massive body of work by someone with such a mythology. We tend to wait, frankly, until they’re dead, so we can more readily see how it all fits together. But you don’t need to be an expert in Cave’s wider cosmology to be swept inside of Ghosteen, to be devastated by its despair and lifted higher by its humanity. You only need the ability to suffer and the desire to survive.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-09,8.8
Summer Walker,Over It,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=pop"">Pop/R&amp;B</a>","Summer Walker’s slow-groove R&B sounds like it was conceived in the parking lot of an Atlanta strip club. Slow and sultry, it shifts from anger to love to frustration in a heartbeat, like she’s both the angel and the devil on your shoulder. The 23-year-old Atlanta singer hardly does interviews, and when she does, it’s like she’s being held against her will, mumbling with an emotionless stare and her hood up. That shyness disappears on records, where her voice is big yet gentle, and the tales pour out.At her best, Summer Walker’s stories play out like a telenovela. On “Me,” a moody track in the middle of her debut album, Over It, she’s heartbroken and unsure how to react, so she runs through her options: not care, or be petty and send him a single-word text. Instead, she checks her purse, then the trunk of her car, and pulls out a gun. “I would never shoot you, baby/Maybe just wave it around,” she sings in a sweet but defeated tone. It’s relatable melodrama for some, maybe a cautionary tale for others.But Walker’s detail is just as rich in the moments that come directly before she reaches her breaking point. “Playing Games” addresses the lame dudes that continue to take her passion for granted, only showing affection in private and refusing to acknowledge their relationship on Instagram. The A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie-assisted “Stretch You Out” shows that frustration beginning to bubble over. “You never wanna clean up/And you talk to me like shit/And you handle me too rough/And, at the end of the day you got the nerve to bring up that bitch,” she sings. Like much of Over It, both tracks feature production from her current love interest and executive producer London on da Track (“Drunk Dialing...LODT” is dedicated to him), who energizes her lovestruck ballads for the social media era with his signature ATL bounce.Occasionally she steers into blander territory, like the well-written but  sleepy “Fun Girl,” but a rotating collection of R&B’s most toxic crooners keeps the energy level high. On “Like It,” Walker is infatuated, while Atlanta’s 6LACK only has sex on his mind. She blames herself for her failed relationships on “Just Might,” her duet with PARTYNEXTDOOR (“I just might be a ho”), while the OVO signee plays the cheating boyfriend with every excuse. The pettiness reaches an apex on “I’ll Kill You,” when she vows “I’ll go to hell or jail about you boy” next to Jhené Aiko, like the final scene of a twisted revenge thriller.Like many of her current R&B peers, Walker is working through her obsession with ’90s R&B. “Body” flips 702’s “Get It Together,” and “Come Thru,” both samples and features Usher. Otherwise, her writing is irresistibly fresh. Whether she has on love goggles or is shaking up her boyfriend by pointing a gun at him—out of love, of course—it’s part of what makes Summer Walker feel like a real person, making the real misguided decisions that happen when you’re over it, or telling yourself that you are.",2019-10-09,7.2
Robert Glasper,Fuck Yo Feelings,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=jazz"">Jazz</a>","In the mini-documentary that accompanies Robert Glasper’s Fuck Yo Feelings, the Grammy-winning pianist and composer explains, “I want this whole thing to be mixtape vibe, so when we put it together it’s like a beat here, might be a song here, then we fuck around talking here.” To achieve this sort of free-form setup, Glasper welcomed a guest list of MCs, singers, and musicians—including Yasiin Bey, Herbie Hancock, YBN Cordae, Denzel Curry, and Audra Day—to pass through a studio in New York City and jam. The goal was to allow the artists to form organic bonds and strike up creative collaborations on the fly. But despite the accomplished cast, there’s little spark about the fruits of those sessions: Fuck Yo Feelings is a 71-minute melange of tepid sonic backdrops that lacks the vital momentum and progression inherent in any effective mixtape.Fuck Yo Feelings begins with an almighty misstep in the shape of the nearly five-minute “Intro,” hosted by comedian and actor Affion Crockett. The premise has Crockett roasting various band members and riffing on the no-fucks-given album title over a growling bass line. It’s a cringe fest. After encouraging the listener to tell the person nearest to them, “Fuck yo feelings,” Crockett breaks into a rant: “You are welcome to fuck they feelings with my dick, disease-free fucking, yeah, fuck they feelings, nasty porno style with some cream on they god damn back.” The barbs are neither shocking or amusing—and the “Intro” completely jars against the prevailing mellow tone of the next 18 songs that follow.The core sound of Fuck Yo Feelings brings to mind the dusky, keys-laced mid-tempo beats that the Ummah trio of Q-Tip, J Dilla, and Ali Shaheed Muhammad mined during the 1990s. Only here the loops are replaced by drummer Chris Dave’s clipped snares, bassist Derrick Hodge’s warm low-end patterns, and Glasper’s feathery keys. The players’ chops are undisputed, but the relaxed, easygoing nature of the grooves they slip into sap the MCs’ bars of energy. Sometimes this happens quite literally, like when the usually erudite Chicago rapper Mick Jenkins gets pushed out of “Let Me In” early, departing the track and letting the song amble along for another three minutes of spacey keys and tippy-tappy drums.When Glasper ushers singers to the forefront, this style of low-key neo-soul production works. During the album’s midsection, the sultry, hushed vocals of Yebba, Audra Day, Baby Rose, and SiR seem to sink into the tracks they sing on. For a moment, there’s a seamless blend between vocal tone and musical backing. But the spell doesn’t last. Instead, the last third of the album becomes a meandering slog that takes in a four-minute shout-out track featuring Glasper’s slurry, pitched-down vocals, plus a series of free-associative musings courtesy of Yasiin Bey that, clocking in at seven minutes, sound like their own self-contained project.The sprawling structure of Fuck Yo Feelings suffers from the same excess that blighted the hip-hop mixtape market during the 2000s, when shunting 20 or 30 tracks onto a project was erroneously seen as a smart hustle rather than something likely to exhaust a listener. Towards the end of Glasper’s mixtape, he names a track after GZA’s crime-rhyme classic Liquid Swords. This is the same learned MC who also once advocated, “Make it brief, son, half short and twice strong”—advice that would have served Fuck Yo Feelings well.",2019-10-09,5.9
Automatic,Signal,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","If Los Angeles trio Automatic had been around in 1978, they’d probably play at the same clubs as their hometown heroes the Go-Go’s—they’re named after the band’s ominous 1982 single. On “Automatic,” Belinda Carlisle hovers over every word like Victor Frankenstein awaiting his monster’s first breath. “No thought, automatic,” her voice clicks. The sentiment is still menacing today, with our necks craned over our phones. With every hypnotic bassline and quotidian criticism on their debut album Signal, Izzy Glaudini, Lola Dompé, and Halle Saxon carry the torch of post-punk precision.The band also has a personal connection to this era of foreboding stares and doomy lyricism: Their percussive engine Lola Dompé is the daughter of Bauhaus drummer Kevin Haskins. Automatic prefer brighter colors, but Signal has a fair amount of darkness and even spookiness to it. The band’s first collection of songs since forming in 2017 is an exercise in post-punk and no-wave galvanism, setting chilly motorik rhythms against contemplations of zombie robots and death.Automatic are minimalists crafting songs with mostly throbbing bass, tight-zipped drumbeats, and synths that evoke the buzz of neon lighting. Album standout “Highway,” which recalls New Order’s “Blue Monday,” has only one lyric (“I drive all night”) but the music captures the restless desire to escape. The drumbeat has the crunchy propulsion of tires running over gravel; shallow bleeps emerge and recede like stripes of road paint. Though most of the production is sparse and controlled, Signal is rich with late-’70s genre influence: “Humanoid” references the psychedelic goth-rock of Bauhaus or Suicide’s “Frankie Teardrop,” while the eerie vocals and post-punk morbidity of “Suicide in Texas” are reminiscent of Joy Division.A fog of apathy plagues Signal. It’s in the repetitive nights out on “Strange Conversations,” the stubborn romantic proclamation of “I Love You, Fine,” and one particularly depressing assertion from lead single “Calling It”: “Emotion is always out of reach.” Glaudini’s deadpan lead vocal suggests the trio has given up hope, or that their hearts have been taken over by a tangle of wires and chrome. “Oh look at me/Machinery of modern life,” goes the anxious title track. We’re all another cog in the machine. “It’s not enough to be alive,” Glaudini chirps. She’s looking “through satellites or lonely nights unsatisfied” for a guiding mechanical transmission. By song’s end, she’s drawn “to wash away the man” in her. Does she seek to scrub away the stains of masculinity, or of humanity?Automatic would be at home in the late ’70s, but their nostalgic, mechanical sound paired with ruminations on cyborgism eventually feel tired and directionless. When Glaudini recounts a jarring transformation on “Humanoid,” her hopelessness is just casual, without stakes. “Signal” and “Electrocution,” the latter inspired by a real-life near-death experience, are gloomy romps with a purposeful sense of dread. But by album’s end, the mesmerizing buzz becomes a numbing sedative. Automatic wrestle with preserving humanity, but at times it seems they’re barely fighting for theirs.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-09,6.4
Wilco,Ode to Joy,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","At the end of his 2018 memoir Let’s Go (So We Can Get Back), Wilco’s Jeff Tweedy noted a shift in his approach to songwriting. Where he once imagined singing only to himself, “pretending no one else is listening,” the personal excavation of the book opened him to the idea of speaking to listeners, imparting exactly what he’d “like to say directly to someone.” That desire for clarity informed his very good recent solo albums, last year’s WARM and this year’s WARMER. Where he once telegraphed emotional truths through murky poetry like a Midwestern John Ashbery, now he was addressing mortality, depression, and malaise head-on. The approach has carried over to Wilco’s 11th studio album, Ode to Joy, a spacious record in both lyrics and sound.Wilco albums have often centered on fears and limitations, but on Ode to Joy, even when Tweedy reflects on the holding patterns that keep us making the same mistakes, there is actual happiness woven into these songs—evidence of the “poetry and magic” Tweedy extols on “Hold Me Anyway.” He’s not sidestepping the fraught tone of the national moment—addressing nationalism, never-ending wars, and the lies we tell ourselves to get by—but he populates the album with surprise flashes of brightness, too. These are love songs about possibilities and the way our vision may be limited by our vantage point. What might a shift in position reveal?Over the course of the last decade, it could be a little hard to tell whether a Wilco record was cruising or coasting. Throughout their catalog, there’s outliers and left-turns, of course: They pushed against roots-rock complacency by embracing violently experimental pop, veered into kosmische musik and distorted meta-commentary. By contrast, Ode to Joy attempts to strip everything down to the bare essentials with a hushed template similar to 2016’s Schmilco. Wilco’s six-piece lineup, in place since 2007’s Sky Blue Sky, has been capable of fireworks, but the focus here is on space. Glenn Kotche—one of rock’s most creative drummers—lays off the cymbals, focusing on bass drum, snare, toms, and rattling percussion. Even when combatively rocking, like on the buzzy “Everyone Hides” and the shuffling “Love Is Everywhere (Beware),” Kotche makes room for skittering keys by Mikael Jorgensen and Pat Sansone and Tweedy’s mellow croon and strained falsetto.Likewise, guitarist Nels Cline lays back in the cut. His jolts of noise have provided reliable spectacle since joining the band following 2004’s A Ghost Is Born (on which Tweedy himself hinted at Cline’s distinctive style), but he’s reserved on Ode to Joy, which makes the few moments he does step out—the apocalyptic solo on “We Were Lucky” and the fuzzed-out glam leads of “Hold Me Anyway”—gleam all the more. The rest of the cast—Sansone, Jorgensen, and bassist John Stirratt, the sole remaining founding Wilco member aside from Tweedy—offers up similarly textured performances. Tweedy matches the band’s volume, resisting the catharsis of giant rock moves in favor of subdued intensity. “I have a quiet amplifier/Silence seems to be more true/Every guitar is denied/I’ve tried in my way to love you,” he sings on “Quiet Amplifier.”In “Before Us,” Tweedy documents hearing a doorbell resonate in the body of his acoustic guitar, leaned up against the wall. That’s the way these songs work—they thrive in negative space. Wilco’s earlier records, Summerteeth, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, and A Ghost Is Born, were artfully packed, stuffed with extra noise and elliptical messages, reflections of their creator’s worry he’d be misunderstood. Like Tweedy’s solo albums, Ode to Joy’s beguiling folk songs are direct and generous, quiet sounds coming from a big room. “Everyone hides,” Tweedy sings, his signature falsetto in place. But not always, only some of the time. A new perspective doesn’t always require blowing everything up—sometimes it just requires a curious tilt of the head.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-08,7.8
DIIV,Deceiver,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","Just a year after DIIV released its sophomore album, Is The Is Are, frontman Zachary Cole Smith conceded it was predicated on a lie. That record purported to be a portrait of addiction and recovery, a tidy narrative culminating in “a light at the end of the tunnel,” but recovery is never as easy as merely willing it, and in truth Smith says he hadn’t committed to sobriety, let alone mastered it. In hindsight, the album’s messaging “really trivializes what people go through,” Smith apologized in a 2017 interview. “Getting sober and staying sober is fucking hard.” He spent much of that year in inpatient treatment, living in rehab facilities and a sober living house, coming to terms with the reality that the light at the end of the tunnel was more distant than he admitted.In a sense, then, DIIV’s third album Deceiver is a do-over, an atonement for a record that, while a triumph on a technical and artistic level, didn’t get the truth right. Like its predecessor, Deceiver is a portrait of addiction and recovery, but this time it’s not quite as tidy, and there’s no suggestion of a victory lap. It plays like the last record’s darker shadow. As with every DIIV album, it sounds timestamped from the year that punk broke, but the mood is heavier, louder, queasier. The guitars jangle less and brood more.The band workshopped many of these songs on the road with Deafheaven, which may account for some of the newfound muscle, but mostly the bluster feels like a natural extension of Smith’s remorseful lyrics. Over knots of Sonic Youth guitars on “Skin Game,” he offers a more unflinching account of self-destruction than anything on Is The Is Are: “Sunken ceiling and a sideways grin/We lived to use and we used to live.” On “Between Tides” he channels Elliott Smith’s falsetto sigh as he sings of living with shame: “Apologize to all I see/For everything I used to be.”Deceiver is trimmer than its predecessor—a relatively compact 10 songs spread over 44 minutes—yet it feels bigger. The luscious shoegaze overtones of the record’s early tracks gradually give way to the creeping unease of Unwound’s autumnal masterpiece Leaves Turn Inside You as Smith's focus turns from the damage he’s done to himself toward the relationships destroyed during “the years I lived in vain, chasing the pain with pain.” In its second half, the record burns hotter and blacker as it stretches toward its seven-minute closer “Acheron,” the dirge that most bears Deafhaven’s influence.That track doesn't quite go full metal, but the lyrics get close: “Hate the god I don’t believe in,” Smith seethes. “Heaven’s just a part of hell.” It should be too much, but isn’t. Smith spends the entire album flirting with self-hatred, dwelling on lies, guilt, and burned bridges. And yet Deceiver never succumbs to miserabilism—even at their dingiest, these songs radiate with a beatific serenity. The lyrics wallow, but the music soars. For a record about regret, Deceiver is an unbridled pleasure.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-08,7.7
Carla dal Forno,Look Up Sharp,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=electronic"">Electronic</a>","Autumn is the most charged of the seasons, and the most melancholy. As English novelist Kate Atkinson wrote in Human Croquet, the air can feel laden with “an aromatic shadow… the fragrance of last year’s apples and the smell of the insides of very old books with a base note of dead, wet rose-petals.” This same haze is conjured in almost everything recorded by London-via-Australia artist Carla dal Forno. A multi-instrumentalist and detail-obsessive, she records albums that, were they images, would be heavy with fog and sepia. She writes, generally, about the longing that precedes and follows relationships, the kind that casts a sillage of tension and want around the surrounding days.Look Up Sharp, dal Forno’s second album and her first on her own Kallista Records, doesn’t depart from her past work so much as coalesce the haze into more of a shape. Dal Forno imprinted on post-punk, and she found a fitting home for her early records amid the doomy, dubby shadows of her former label, London-based Blackest Ever Black. But there’s an equally strong current of folk influence to her music, specifically the stark, lo-fi records of Virginia Astley and former labelmates Gareth Williams and Marie Currie. The midpoint of the genres is a shadowy space occupied by goth-folk singer-songwriters like Emma Ruth Rundle or Laura Sheeran, or the cello-and-violin mood pieces of former 4AD session musicians Martin and Kimberlee McCarrick. This is where dal Forno is at home, and newly assured.The arrangements—starting with the first lead bass notes of “No Trace”—are more muscular. Her vocals move from foreground to background, though there are still moments where you might swear you’d heard the voice of Broadcast’s Trish Keenan: the soprano brushstrokes of “No Trace,” the trip-hop murmurs of “Push On,” or the austere, layered choral opening to “Don’t Follow Me.” Her lyrics are more direct, even pointed. Single “So Much Better” isn’t just direct for dal Forno; lines like “you were a disaster, I’m glad I caused you pain” would be blunt coming from anyone. (“I had to trick myself that it was a bit of a joke that I was writing these lyrics down,” she said of writing the track.) It’s a calm anger, though: The song moves slowly, with deliberately paced bass and measured, almost deadpan vocals, like a grudge held so long and rehearsed so often it’s become an internal rhythm. “I’m Conscious” is less conflicted: “I crave drama,” she sings, and the track she conjures delivers. It’s as if, seeing romantic disaster approaching like thunderheads, she’s decided to go storm chasing.Dal Forno can afford such candor; her arrangements are flush with subtext as is. “Took a Long Time” and “Push On” bloom with “Teardrop”-esque percussion shudders. “Don’t Follow Me,” a lyrical nod to the Cure’s “A Forest,” suspends dal Forno’s vocals above a grotty low end like thick moss. And the instrumentals on Look Up Sharp are characteristically palpable: a string solo on “Heart of Hearts,” the most McCarricks-like track here; the late-night meditations of “Leaving for Japan” and “Creep Out of Bed,” one neon and one smoky; the stark foreground-background arrangement of “Hype Sleep,” where clock ticks, live-wire buzzes, and longing woodwind fade in and out around a heavy, perseverating lead bass line. It is, as they say, an extremely big mood, and dal Forno is by now an expert at setting them.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-08,7.5
Kris Davis,Diatom Ribbons,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=jazz"">Jazz</a>","Not long after Cecil Taylor’s death, the Tzadik label crafted a tribute album involving six pianists. To find Kris Davis among their number was likely little surprise to fans of contemporary jazz, given that her live performances at New York venues like Roulette and the Stone have long shown off her melodic and percussive mastery of post-Taylor pianism. But she is not just a star soloist. One recent, notated composition of Davis’ was included on an exciting set of contemporary classical pieces performed by the pianist Rory Cowal. She is also an adventurous collaborator, working in a wide variety of ensembles.That range is one of the principal delights of Diatom Ribbons, Davis’ latest release on her own label. (Yes, she’s an impresario, too.) Wilco’s Nels Cline appears on several tracks, and sometime Tom Waits sideman Marc Ribot also shows up on a couple. Both of those guitarists hold firmly established identities in the contemporary jazz firmament, though it’s not often that you’ll find them on an album that also features two guest spots from Esperanza Spalding (working only as a vocalist here). Davis’ organizational insight holds that all of these artists contain multitudes, and that it shouldn’t be so unusual to hear them grouped together.That the stylistically diverse results flow so well, over the course of an hour and 10 tracks—all but two composed by Davis—is also partly due to a band within the band. The album gains a sense of unity thanks to a trio of players that shows up regularly amid the comings and goings of guest stars: veteran drummer Terri Lyne Carrington,  rising-star DJ Val Jeanty, and Davis herself on piano.The trio’s collective attack sets the pace during the first minute of the arresting title track, which opens the album. First Davis, on a prepared piano, plays riffs full of metallic timbres while Jeanty samples spoken—but highly musical—phrases from Cecil Taylor himself. Carrington settles into a groove not long before Taylor’s line, “For me, music saved my life”—a construction that inspires Davis to introduce new percussive figures. Soon after, Jeanty retreats for a bit, making room for a bassist (Trevor Dunn) and a pair of tenor sax players (JD Allen and Tony Malaby).There’s a lot going on here, including melodically captivating soloing, an intergenerational shout-out, and various experimental textures. But instead of being a jumble, it’s a triumph. Spalding’s voice gets the spotlight on the next track, “The Very Thing” (written by Davis associate Michaël Attias). But Jeanty again provides crucial work during this performance, attaching delicate trails of whispery turntablism to some of Spalding’s highest notes.Carrington, Jeanty, and Davis also construct the head-nod feel at the outset of “Rhizomes” (with the help of onetime Xiu Xiu drummer Ches Smith on vibraphone). But Carrington is soon ably shifting into rock-adjacent territory before Cline enters with an energetic solo of lightly distorted tones.That covers about the first 16 minutes of the album. There are plenty of highlights yet to come, including “Corn Crake,” the core trio’s standalone number, during which Jeanty samples oration from the French modernist composer Olivier Messiaen. But no matter how unusual the compositional structures may seem, there is a consistent, songful style at the heart of most performances.The major exception to this rule is “Golgi Complex,” a short tour through a chaotic complex of motifs. But even here, Davis pursues a variety of approaches: The composition is presented twice on the album, with the original, more forbidding version sequenced second, after another variation that has an air of funk-indebted swing. Even when Diatom Ribbons ventures into unapologetically avant-garde territory, there is a clear desire to make each choice communicate. When expertly realized by such a vibrant cast of collaborators, this suite of strategies brings several of Davis’ skills—as a player, composer, and bandleader—to a new, heightened state of expression.",2019-10-08,8.1
Danny Brown,uknowhatimsayin¿,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rap"">Rap</a>","Danny Brown’s breakout album came the year he turned 30. Now that he’s closing in on 40, he doesn’t seem to be settling into an elder-statesman role; judging by his new album uknowhatimsayin¿, he hasn’t settled at all. “Never look back, I will never change up,” he chants repeatedly on the first song—a vow to never let a groove become a rut, to stay the same without repeating yourself. It’s a lonely sort of promise, but it’s one that he’s kept: He remains as defiantly hard to situate now in the rap landscape today as he was in 2011.Back then, he was ostentatiously weird, a gap-toothed Detroit rapper with a hyena voice who forever altered the smell and taste of Cool Ranch Doritos, a weirdo fashion plate back when something as mild as skinny jeans could cost you a label deal. Now that he looks like an original X-Man to SoundCloud rap’s New Mutants, he’s still an outlier: His devotion to punchlines and similes makes him sound almost rigid in the melted, borderless landscape of current rap. But this is the joy and pain of being a three-dimensional human in your records, over and over again; if you do it correctly, you’ll never quite fit in anywhere, ever.When he announced that Q-Tip was going to executive-produce his new album, he reaffirmed that he was a classicist at heart, an old-school formalist in freak’s clothing. They are an odd pairing, The Abstract and The Hybrid; Q-Tip’s music has always felt comfortable and lived-in—wipe your feet on the rug, relax yourself, please settle down. His aesthetic is built on leaving space while figuring out how to make the quietest sound the most interesting one. Danny Brown’s most compelling music, meanwhile, has usually felt ready to leap out of its own skin, full of scraped nerves, nosebleeds, migraines, grinding teeth.Working with Tip, Brown doesn’t tone his style down so much as modulate it, dotting his voice across these tracks like wasabi blobs. He mostly forgoes the downward-spiral theatrics of 2016’s Atrocity Exhibition and 2013’s Old, opting for punchlines and vivid images and creative cadences—trace over the jagged rhyme patterns of a song like “Negro Spiritual” and you might prick your finger. He stagger-steps around the looped guitar so nimbly it might escape your notice that he rhymes “on par,” “rental car,” “centaur,” and “Pat Benatar” within one 20-second gulp of breath.Brown usually lunges out of beats, but here melts into them, making himself just another bright leaping dot on a cartoon assembly line. Individual production credits come from longtime collaborator Paul White, JPEGMAFIA, Flying Lotus, and Q-Tip himself, who coaxes and calms these nervy beats into a free-flowing suite, full of irregular rhythms and snipped edges. The snare snap on JPEG’s “3 Tearz” hits either a half-second later or sooner than you expect, prompting the loosest and most unpredictable verses from Killer Mike and El-P in years. Q-Tip’s own “Dirty Laundry” basically loops a full minute of “Aurora Spinray,” a quivering instrumental from the early-’70s psychedelic group Syrinx, and destabilizes the rhythm so much that listening to it feels walking across a waterbed.These are the kinds of tactile pleasures uknowhatimsayin¿ offers. Brown has never sounded more musical, natural, or locked-in. He reels off quotable lines everywhere; “Henny got me wetter than whale piss/I’mma die for this shit like Elvis” from “Combat” is a particularly rich one, as is, “I ignore a whore like an email from LinkedIn” from “Savage Nomad.” Structurally, at least, he’s a punchline rapper, and from this angle, producing him might not be that different from producing a happy pugilist like Phife Dawg, who similarly wanted to fill whatever small container he was given with the maximum amount of his personality. As he trades bars with Tip over the trilling horn loop on “Combat Zone,” it sounds like Brown has ascended to a sort of hip-hop classicist nirvana, a place where every kick drum lands just-so, every sample clears effortlessly, every loop cuts off exactly where it should.If there’s anything missing from uknowhatimsayin¿, it’s a sense of mortal stakes, a feeling that this music matters to Brown on a gut level. His best music has always been overwhelmingly personal, and when he declared that he would be the “greatest rapper ever” on XXX’s “30,” the implication was that he might die if he failed. It is an unqualified good thing that he is not rapping about suicidal thoughts, depression, isolation, and drug abuse anymore, but whatever else is in his head is missing. There is no moment where Brown grabs your lapels and demands you to feel what he’s feeling, whatever it may be. He has called uknowhatimsayin¿ his “standup comedy album,” and the mastery on display is that of the comic going out there and killing. But the best-loved and most enduring comedians left their own blood out on the stage, too.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-07,8.1
Glenn Branca,The Third Ascension,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=experimental"">Experimental</a>","“There are very few animals that kill their own kind.” Avant-garde composer Glenn Branca often began interviews with bleak screeds on human existence. “We’re vicious, psychopathological beasts,” he said in 2011, referring to our planet as a “disgusting shithole.” It was easy to take one look at Branca, drink in hand and perpetually smoking, and think you had him figured out. It was even easier to hear his vitriolic compositions and find them oppressive and terrifying, as John Cage famously did in 1982. But there was always an armored optimism in Branca’s work that suggested: If we can get lost in this maddening sound, we might be able to transcend our shared shithole, if only for a moment. With Branca’s final work The Third Ascension, released a year and a half after he died of throat cancer, the composer and his ensemble take the familiar instruments of a rock band and transform them into machines of calculated pandemonium, whose noise is so merciless it’s blissful.The concluding entry in his Ascension series, The Third Ascension premiered at New York’s famed art space the Kitchen in February 2016, where Branca and his ensemble were recorded for this very album. Branca, dressed in his trademark black duster and slacks, flailed around the stage as he conducted for bass, drums, and four guitars (one of which was played by his wife, Reg Bloor). His movements were spasmodic, and he occasionally shimmied his hips like a beleaguered Elvis. He grumbled between songs, brief quips about the best hot dog he’d ever eaten, or a dig at John Zorn. He kept his sheet music in a plastic shopping bag, which, if memory serves, had a yellow smiley face on the front. It was the only concert I’d ever been to where earplugs were forcefully handed out at the entrance, like safety goggles at a gun range.Branca was known to say that if you didn’t like loud music, you shouldn’t bother with his. At live performances, you had no option regarding volume. When it comes to his albums, you unfortunately do. But heed the man’s words: The Third Ascension should be played at full blast, neighbors and landlords be damned. One of the most exhilarating aspects of Branca’s music is the amount of aural hallucination it inspires—a frequent side effect of listening to his work is hearing things that aren’t really there. “The Smoke,” a 16-minute odyssey that kicks off like the opening credits in a western film, eventually bursts into a fit of distortion, and it appears as though a synthesizer simulating gale-force winds has been added to the mix. On closing opus “Cold Thing,” Branca’s guitar quartet sounds like a squad of machine guns firing at point blank range, and yet the continued roar somehow registers as distant screaming, air raid sirens, and a choir of angels all at once.This psychoacoustic mindfuck is all part of the plan. “I want you to be confused,” Branca once said of his audience. “Because if you become a little confused, then you’re not sure what you’re hearing, and that’s the point at which you can start thinking about what you’re hearing, and you can start creating what you’re hearing.” The Third Ascension, much like Branca’s masterpieces The Ascension and Lesson No. 1, is a shrine to ecstatic disorientation. It is both exhausting and elating, so much so that the end of each song coincides with a deserved deep breath.Branca’s work has always been as much of a physical experience as a musical one, and The Third Ascension continues that tradition beautifully. The high-frequency guitar riffs piercing through “Twisting in Space” feel like individual pin pricks, and the dueling rhythms in “Lesson No. 4” might as well be a series of 2x4s bashing you in the face. It’s a glorious, numbing assault.Glenn Branca did not like the word “transcendence,” but he knew that was the ultimate goal. “I want everything in the world, in every minute of every piece,” he once said. “I want to create a small universe on that stage, and take you off of this earth, into a place that isn’t this fucking shithole.” Branca has finally escaped. Consider The Third Ascension his parting gift.",2019-10-07,8.0
Kaputt,Carnage Hall,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","Of all the ways to say something is fucked, “kaputt” might be the cheeriest and most playful. There’s an almost cartoonish quality to the word, conjuring images of blown gaskets and billowing smoke. Yet it’s a silly-sounding word that cuts straight to the heart of capitalism’s great folly: It’s a system whose survival depends on selling you useless, instantly obsolete junk over and over again. So it’s fitting that, on their debut album, the Glaswegian sextet who call themselves Kaputt proffer a style of post-punk that is both highly combustible and patently absurd.Carnage Hall is built atop a wobbly foundation of familiar post-punk totems: the wiry energy of early B-52’s, the bass-string-snapping rhythmic contortions of Minutemen, the melody-resistant rants and cheerleader chants of Brix-era Fall, and the sort of saxy violence that coursed through feisty freaks from X-Ray Spex to Love Is All. But in sharp contrast to your typical Mark E. Smith-modeled sing-spieler, Kaputt lead singer Cal Donnelly isn’t especially cranky—his elastic voice sounds both permanently gobsmacked and full of bravado, like someone who’s gotten clocked in a bar fight and, amazed to be still standing, marvels at the imaginary stars swirling around them. The first words we hear him sing on album opener “Rats” are, “It’s so much/Darker now,” but while a sudden breakdown at the 28-second mark braces you for a hit of chaotic skronk, the track instantly reanimates itself as an upbeat, brass-powered thrust that invites you to dance your worries away.As “Rats” illustrates, Kaputt excel at making complicated songs sound fun. Even Carnage Hall’s most tightly wound rave-ups, like the D. Boon-worthy “Very Satisfied” and the call-and-response sprint “Parsonage Square,” pack surprise structural shifts and outta-nowhere hooks, with percussionist Emma Smith’s restless clatter providing the destabilizing counterpoint to bassist Tobias Carmichael and drummer Rikki Will’s vacuum-sealed rhythms. Donnelly’s wordplay cuts through the clamor with lyrics that are as bleakly satirical as they are brutally efficient. On “Feed My Son,” he takes on patriarchy and gluttony in a single couplet, singing, “I need to feed my son/Need him to grow big, big and strong,” before adding an ominous twist: “I need to eat to my son, he’s grown to twice the size of a normal one!”Donnelly’s innate theatricality is most effective on Carnage Hall’s more manic tracks, where he can pinball off of guitarist Simone Wilson and saxophonist Chrissy Barnacle’s punk-rock pep-rally harmonies. His unwavering bug-eyed intensity feels out of place when the band eases off the accelerator for slow-burn struts like “Hi! I’m the Wasp” or more light-hearted fare like “You Are Buried With My Nose.” But the band successfully ventures beyond the typical dance-punk parameters on Carnage Hall’s two-part centerpiece, “Drinking Problems Continue.” It is, in many senses, the album’s most despairing song, an unflinching portrait of escape from industrial-town misery via alcoholism. (“Metal smell roll off hill, burn my nostrils further,” Connelly sings, before sardonically adding, “I love this place like no other.”) But it’s also the album’s most joyous moment, with a boisterous Afropop groove that gives way to an ecstatic group chorus—a readymade self-help anthem for when all your hopes and dreams go kaputt.",2019-10-07,7.1
WIVES,So Removed,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","Had they emerged 15 years ago, it’s easy to imagine the Queens band WIVES getting scooped up by RCA in the post-Strokes feeding frenzy and lingering on the fringes of the New York Y2K rock renaissance just long enough to collect a few saucy backstage anecdotes about Albert Hammond Jr. to share in Meet Me in the Bathroom. But seeing as the infrastructure to hype up post-punky garage bands has all but disappeared in 2019, this quartet are free to be as weird and wired as they want to be. By channelling the locomotive rumble of the Velvet Underground, the menacing, bass-driven pulse of the Fall, and the surrealistic musings of the Pixies, WIVES eagerly hitch themselves to a long lineage of anti-social record-collector rock.But more than any particular band, their debut evokes a bygone era when underground New York City rock bands couldn’t help but reflect their seedy surroundings (back when there were still seedy surroundings to reflect). At a time when so much of the music we engage with is grappling—whether overtly or implicitly—with political turmoil and mental health, So Removed feels, well, so removed from the current conversation. Instead, WIVES coolly roam a subterranean nocturnal netherworld of their own design.WIVES guitarist Andrew Bailey is also a founding member of dream-pop phenoms DIIV, but any connection between the two outfits ends there. Fitting for a group that formed because one of its members had some leftover time at his practice space, WIVES conceal an improvisational jam-band soul in a punk band’s body—though in their case, the jamming is verbal. On the opening “Waving Past Nirvana,” singer/guitarist James Beach rifles through a series of free-associative internal rhymes and open-ended kickers (“And your uncle, he wears a dress/With a shotgun and some meth/And no teeth where he peeks in his mirror to speak in tongues”) sounding like Black Francis after a CBD-oil massage.Beach’s musings are the focal point of every WIVES song, but his presence isn’t always enough to invigorate the album’s more even-keeled tracks, like the Stonesy rocker “Servants” or “Why Is Life,” which recalls post-reunion Pixies. But Beach can deliver the hooks when he tries: “The 20 Teens” relocates the E Street Band to the corner of Lexington and 125, while the glam racket of “Hideaway” yields the album’s most quotable chorus (“Don’t you sweat it girl/You’ll regret it, girl/You’re doing all the cocaine in the world”). In fact, there’s enough evidence here to suggest here that WIVES’ true calling is to shake off the agitated post-punk posture and embrace their inner Marc Bolan: On the space-bound ballad “The Future Is a Drag,” they bow out with a rusted-out “Metal Guru” to call their own. “We blew it, just for kicks,” Beach sings as the planet around him crumbles, but he doesn’t sound too bummed—because this song is his first-class ticket from the gutter to the stars.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-07,6.9
John Mayer,Room for Squares,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","John Mayer has always been something of a critical bête noir. His gentle, mawkish songwriting juxtaposed against his caddish, clownish behavior has created a friction that is at best unappealing and at worst artistically dishonest. At the height of his fame in the mid- to late-’00s, as the guitar virtuoso and singer-songwriter was vacuuming up Grammys for harmless pablum like “Daughters” and “Say,” he became known for a notorious string of celebrity exes, from Jennifer Aniston to Jessica Simpson to Taylor Swift. Once a dependable source of amusing copy, he beat a forced retreat from the Hollywood media sphere after his increasingly incendiary interviews culminated in the use of a racial slur, followed by his tearful onstage apology during a February 2010 show in Nashville.Yet since Mayer has stepped out of the spotlight, he has entered an unlikely career renaissance. His three solo albums since his self-induced purgatory have been understated, exploratory; his mind expanding according to the size of his hat. His work when he is not billed under his own name, especially, has been fascinating to behold. Mayer blazes an uncredited guitar solo on one of the best songs on one of the 2010s’ greatest albums, Frank Ocean’s Channel Orange, and since 2015, he has been touring, with Dead & Co., as the de facto leader for what remains of the Grateful Dead. To replace Jerry Garcia and be warmly accepted into the Deadhead community is not something you could have predicted from the guy who once donned a Borat-inspired lime-green “mankini” on a festival cruise ship called the Mayer Carrier.But at the start of the millennium, Mayer was just a nobody with a website, exploiting his wide-eyed lyrical clarity and chopsy musicianship to capture a teen audience readied by the college-quad strums of Dave Matthews Band and David Gray. “Welcome to the real world,” he sings at the start of Room for Squares. The giveaway is that he’s attributing these words not to himself, but to an unspecified authority figure. His major-label debut, released when he was 23 but largely written when he was at least a couple of years younger, is not the real world. Its opening track, “No Such Thing,” denies that one even exists, “just a lie you have to rise above.”Room for Squares offers a willfully innocent fantasy. Life can be as safe, as self-consciously cute, as broadly appealing as a really popular sitcom. The Crayola-bright soundtrack echoes the music of the protagonist’s childhood, particularly early MTV hits by the Police and Elvis Costello. He wins over audiences with sincerity and admitting his faults; the music is smooth because people are not. What Mayer describes on the album as a “quarter-life crisis” is also a privileged space, a temporary sanctuary from becoming an adult. This is a place where it’s OK to make yourself vulnerable as you figure out who you’re going to become.As a kid in suburban Connecticut, Mayer wanted to play the guitar after watching Michael J. Fox in Back to the Future. A neighbor passed him a tape by Stevie Ray Vaughan in 1990, the year Mayer turned 13, and he grew worryingly obsessed. “Everyone else had Nirvana, and I was skipping class, reading the Buddy Guy biography Damn Right, I’ve Got the Blues, cutting out the pictures when I was done,” he has said. A few years later, when he was 17, Mayer told his mother and father—an English teacher and a high school principal, respectively—he wanted to skip college and become a musician. They did not react well. Mayer began to suffer from panic attacks. He dreaded landing in a mental hospital.After graduating from high school in 1995, Mayer worked for two years at a gas station and played in blues clubs at night. When he realized that his “dreams of staying in Connecticut and becoming a star from home,” as he once put it, weren’t going to happen, he briefly enrolled in Boston’s Berklee School of Music. It wasn’t a fit, and, wanting to be “listenable,” he moved to Atlanta, where he and co-songwriter Clay Cook, later of the Zac Brown Band, won an open-mic contest as a short-lived duo, Lo-Fi Masters. Mayer self-released a coffeehouse-tinged solo EP, Inside Wants Out, in 1999. By the fall of 2000, anyone could hear early versions of several Room for Squares songs via his page on MP3.com, which acted like MySpace, SoundCloud, or Bandcamp for unknown artists right before the dotcom bust. In a nod toward the jam band scene, Mayer also encouraged fans to tape his live shows and circulate the recordings.If Mayer initially gravitated toward the blues, he escaped whatever was on his trail through his accessibility and relentless eagerness to please. (You can picture the genre’s fabled hellhound walking away thinking, “What a nice young man.”) Room for Squares shares a producer, in John Alagia, with Dave Matthews Band, who came up a lot as a comparison for Mayer’s percussive acoustic guitar playing and slightly congested vocals. But the album feels more polished than that. “I was trying to make the most mature-sounding immature record in the world,” Mayer once said, adding later, “It’s almost a concept album about being really shamelessly melodic.” His ambitions leaned toward pop. The title, which happens to be flipped from jazz great Hank Mobley’s 1963 album No Room for Squares, is Mayer laying out a welcome mat. It’s as if to say: No prerequisites to your enjoyment here.The most all-around shameless track on Room for Squares is its mid-tempo slow jam, “Your Body Is a Wonderland.” Squint hard enough, and you can almost see the sun peeking between dorm-room window curtains. Like everything on the album, it’s a bit much—“Your skin like porcelain” is an objectively bad lyric, and “bubblegum tongue” is just ridiculous. But if you grew up listening to ’90s R&B, it isn’t that much more ridiculous than Hi-Five smooching and telling on “I Like the Way (The Kissing Game),” or Shai asking to be your “Comforter.” Mayer himself quipped, during a video-streamed 2000 gig, that “Wonderland” should start with a husky spoken-word intro: “...And in the morning, girl, I’m gonna pour you a bowl of Count Chocula, and I’m gonna pull some of the oat pieces out so it tastes like there’s just more marshmallow.” As bubblegum-tongue afternoon delights go, it’s an endearingly silly ode, both tender and curious. If Lady Bird could rescue “Crash Into Me,” maybe there’s hope for “Wonderland” yet.Mayer is at his most affecting here when he’s singing about feeling lost and scared. The soaring chorus of “Why Georgia” nails a particular youthful anxiety that’s quite different from what critics usually mean by “angst,” and maybe a bit more sheltered, too: “I wonder sometimes about the outcome of a still-verdictless life/Am I living it right?” On “Not Myself,” more like an early Coldplay song with its lyrical economy and sweeping, open chords, Mayer trusts a friend to wait him out if “I lose my worried mind”: “Suppose I said, you’re my saving grace,” he booms, as much as Mayer ever booms. When you’re in a crowd of people mouthing these words back alongside you, you might feel a little less lost and scared yourself.He would soon be routinely touted as a “heartthrob,” but these are the songs of a young person who has spent a lot of solitary hours in their bedroom. On “83,” which makes plain the early MTV influence by shouting out the Police’s “Wrapped Around Your Finger,” Mayer longs “to be 6 again,” and the Peter Pan syndrome is intensely vivid: “That’s my plastic in the dirt,” he sings, a Lost Boy wryly alerting future homeowners to lost toys. “Great Indoors” uses blocks of electric guitar and more Mayer wordplay to empathize with a TV-gazing shut-in. “Love Song for No One” is one of those ditties you can’t believe hadn’t been written yet. Here, again, the perspective is curiously childlike: “I could’ve met you in a sandbox,” he claims. “Back to You” has a gentle groove distantly reminiscent of Jeff Buckley’s “Everybody Here Wants You”—it struts, as much as Mayer here ever struts—but his lover is just a silhouette, who wouldn’t even smile in their final photo.When Mayer steps out of the bedroom, he’s still awkward. On the bouncy “My Stupid Mouth,” with its goofy false ending, he’s as winsome about ruining a date as he is about engaging in foreplay on “Wonderland.” On “Neon,” the object of the narrator’s affection is out soaking up Atlanta’s nightlife, and why shouldn’t she be? Mayer was a non-punk straight-edge guy; the song is mainly a fine showcase for his irksomely giant-thumbed guitar flash. Mayer gets in more licks on “City Love,” a blues-drizzled love letter to New York romance where he unforgettably humblebrags, “She keeps her toothbrush at my place/As if I had the extra space.” Listening back, you can sort of sense his ego about to balloon.Critics have long been averse to this record’s charms because, at its best, Room for Squares is an antidote to exclusion. It’s a coming-of-age album that refuses to pose as rebellious, a guilty pleasure that challenges the idea there should be guilt in pleasure. Arriving when assembly-line teen-pop and aggro nu-metal still ruled the airwaves, the album proved that pop could be delivered by the precocious boy with the guitar next door. The confident vulnerability of early Drake and the sharp-eyed clarity of early Taylor Swift, but also the man-child strums of Ed Sheeran, Shawn Mendes, and the Jonas Brothers, all have precursors here. Teenagers screamed. Elton John raved.Room for Squares is also a time capsule. Columbia issued the album a week after the attacks of September 11. Nostalgic reassurance was in high demand, and it’s possible that only children of sanitized ’80s America would recognize the music’s cozy solace. Mayer’s big-tent pop now feels like the last gasp of the old monoculture in the face of digital fragmentation, but it also reminds me of all those movies where the straight, white, middle-class, and (cis) male is presented as the default perspective; the fans were a diverse bunch (including the Roots’ Questlove), but the women in his songs are faceless. And while sincerity was Mayer’s stock-in-trade—he wields it “like a pitchfork,” Time’s Josh Tyrangiel later wrote—he has turned out to be more of a scoundrel, or perhaps an enigma, than some doe-eyed romantic. John Mayer is constantly performing “John Mayer,” whether he wants to or not.I’m not sure the music we loved when we were younger becomes less valuable just because we no longer need what it has to offer. Over the years, I’ve adored plenty of albums that reflect the richly varied ways we are each different, individual, weird. I listened to Room for Squares the most when I wanted to feel normal. Not “normcore”: Just normal. A little less alone; a little more accepted. “You will know what all this time was for,” Mayer promises as “No Such Thing” rings to a conclusion. I just know that expressing what’s true, for yourself or for a group of people, can make a bigger difference than anyone realizes in the moment. Room for Squares, for all of its baggage, remains a little guitar-pop utopia where it’s OK to keep discovering ourselves as we go along.",2019-10-06,7.8
Michael Vincent Waller,Moments,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=experimental"">Experimental</a>","Since its founding in Tommy McCutchon’s Austin apartment in 2006, the Unseen Worlds imprint has become a refined voice in late 20th- and early 21st-century explorations, whether exalting a historically neglected female composer like Laurie Spiegel or reissuing albums that plumb the divide between pop and avant-garde. Alongside reissues, Unseen Worlds has also offered up an adventurous exploration of contemporary piano music. Releases run the gamut from stately solo piano pieces by Ethiopian classical composer Girma Yifrashewa to achingly slow takes on Erik Satie by founding Fluxus member Philip Corner to a stunning modern ambient album from jungle/breakcore pioneer Robert Haigh.This year the label adds two new entries to that list, first Hague-based Leo Svirsky’s River Without Banks and now Michael Vincent Waller’s third album, Moments. Waller’s 2015 double-disc debut The South Shore found the New York-based composer presenting a diverse array of works written over a five-year period, with some 20 total players performing pieces for solo cello, string quartet, flute, and a saxophone and electric guitar ensemble. On 2017’s Trajectories, Waller narrowed his focus to the interplay between cello and piano. Moments zooms in even further; five of the 18 compositions presented here are for vibraphone, the remainder for solo piano. R. Andrew Lee, pianist on Trajectories and a noted interpreter for minimal composers like Dennis Johnson and Jürg Frey, is again seated at the bench. Waller enlists William Winant—percussionist to the likes of John Zorn, Frank Zappa, and Roscoe Mitchell—on vibraphone. Both men are renowned for their restraint, and they are a perfect fit for Waller’s sensibilities. Every note and gesture on Moments seems to be deeply felt and philosophically weighed before a hand touches a piano key or lifts a mallet.Waller is uninterested in hiding behind any sort of artifice in his compositions, conveying sentiment as directly through the notation as possible. There’s little reverb to the recording, no electronic processing or layering; the sustaining pedal isn’t depressed for the duration of the album. He’s uninterested in a larger canvas when a postcard will suffice. None of the compositions last longer than six minutes, and many speak their piece well before the three-minute mark. Waller seems as attuned to the notes struck as to the overtones produced and their natural decay, which perhaps comes from his studies with minimalist composers like La Monte Young and Bunita Marcus, the latter perhaps best known for the piece that composer Morton Feldman named for her.Erik Satie’s name comes up in almost every writing about Waller, and it’s hard not recall Satie’s “Gymnopédie No. 1” during a passage on Waller’s own melancholic “Nocturnes - No. 4.” But Feldman is the more telling reference, especially in Waller’s balance and exploration of the instruments’ attack and decay. “Vibrafono Studio” wraps itself in warm, lingering tones, pausing every few lines to let the overtones fade away. The gorgeous “Jennifer”—dedicated to his cousin—moves swiftly from its opening chords to a flurry of high notes before drawing to half-speed, carefully exploring a descending bass melody that offers each note ample space in which to sound. His dedication to the late Pauline Oliveros, “For Pauline,” exemplifies her tenets of “deep listening” not with a durational, large-scale composition akin to her own work, but with three gentle minutes wherein each of Lee’s chords moves like steps across slippery river stones.As understated as Waller’s writing is, and as self-contained and seamless as each piece is, it’s almost startling when the album arrives at the stunning finale of “Bounding.” Lee’s playing starts off measured, but soon gathers velocity, each run quickening the pace until it reaches an evocative peak. The final third of the piece gushes forth in a cascade, the emotional restraint of the album finally giving way to release. As sterling and subtle as Moments can be, the finale feels nothing less than cathartic.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-05,7.8
Sheff G,The Unluccy Luccy Kid,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rap"">Rap</a>","Sheff G’s The Unluccy Luccy Kid comes two years after his breakout “No Suburban.” The eerie anthem found the Flatbush native convincingly adopting Brooklyn drill’s signifiers—brusque threats, lingo-filled punchlines, and a video of hoodied-up men whose ages were betrayed by their backpacks. Millions of clicks later in 2019, Sheff G is still something of an underdog: Unluccy Luccy Kid comes after Canarsie’s Pop Smoke took over the summer with “Welcome to the Party.” The spotlight’s redirection hasn’t deterred Sheff, though. The production here is cleaner, but his debut project finds him repacking his style instead of making large steps forward.The Unluccy Luccy Kid feels more like an industry necessity than a statement. A few of its tracks can stick out on their own, like the previously released “Flows,” his bluesy collaboration with fellow Brooklynite Sleepy Hallow. But strung together, these tracks are dulled by their own repetitiveness. You’ve heard all these grievances elsewhere: We came from the struggle, don’t like fake love or snitches, and don’t pretend you shot somebody, just be yourself.Sheff G largely avoids the introspection or detail that would give these tropes weight. He broods about being “a product of power and pain” over the funereal pianos of “Respect,” but his verses are pridefully elliptical about what that means: “Never talked what I did/Still I will never talk what I saw.” To be fair, that’s not really anybody’s business; however, Mozzy’s vivid verse on the ghostly “Menace” (“Meet me on Fourth, right by the court/None of these shooting guards play around”) has more resonance.Sheff G largely relies on the compact, off-beat syllabic barrages that he rode on “No Suburban.” His approach works best when he’s not trying to contort that flow into singsong melodies, like the clumsy and generic “Designer.” Sleepy Hallow appears on half of the project’s tracks and does well as the choleric foil to Sheff’s bearish presence, landing many of the album’s darkest jabs (“What can they tell me about the trenches, almost lost my sense/So if my name is ever mentioned just tell the judge send a sentence,” he raps on “All My Life,” darkly humorous but dead serious).The Unluccy Luccy Kid isn’t going to be the groundbreaker that pops the Brooklyn drill scene out of its bubble, but that’s probably how it was designed. Sheff G and Sleepy Hallow sound more engaged when they’re rapping unapologetically about street dealings. A few of drill’s artists have expressed making music mainly for the folks who walked those streets. If Unluccy Luccy Kid connects with them, hasn’t it served its purpose?",2019-10-05,6.4
Harmony Woods,Make Yourself at Home,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","Before Sofia Verbilla began making music as Harmony Woods, she was dragging friends to gigs around her native Philadelphia, introducing her peers to the city’s DIY scene and pining for a chance to meet her local rock heroes. Inspired by the same bands she moshed to, Verbilla finished writing her first song when she was 16. By 18, she was playing solo sets at the same house show space that members of Modern Baseball once called home. Some of the band even helped her record Harmony Woods’ debut, 2017’s Nothing Special. But there was surely something special about Verbilla; with crystal-clear vocals and evocative lyrics, she was primed to become a fixture of Philly’s underground.The title of Harmony Woods’ follow-up LP, Make Yourself at Home, is less welcoming than it appears: “So make yourself at home, although you weren’t invited,” Verbilla offers on lead single “Best Laid Plans.” It’s the kind of passive-aggressive comment you might make to someone who’s crashed on your couch a few nights too many, but it’s also an apt summary of a record that examines self-sabotage. Verbilla sings about devoting too much emotional real estate to people who don’t necessarily deserve it, or—in her own meme-formatted words—romanticizing their toxic behaviors. She’s learning to prioritize her own well-being, and Make Yourself at Home unearths the ugly side of that maturation.Verbilla is an affecting lyricist; her words are candid, unglamorous, and often graphic recollections of trauma. “I can’t feel safe around you/Not when you’re like this,” she laments in the jarring “Misled,” as if channeling pain directly from childhood. “When I was young/My mother’s lover acted the same exact way.” The album also describes the agonizing process of unpicking an abusive relationship, alluding to domestic violence and gaslighting. “You slam the car door shut accidentally/Profusely apologize/You say, ‘That’s not like me,’” she sings on “The City’s Our Song,” with enough hindsight to realize it was indeed characteristic of her subject. “Now all I want is the truth/But you’re frightening me instead/You say, ‘I think you’ve been misled,’” she sings in “Misled.” Verbilla regularly employs her villains’ dialogue, and Make Yourself at Home can feel as much about them as it is about her.She’s also a fan of recycling lyrics: “Seasons change, people stay the same,” she muses in both “Best Laid Plans” and closer “Halt.” “One day we will die/And only ghosts will be our friends,” she sings in “The City’s Our Song,” only to reiterate the thought on “Ghosts.” On first pass, it can feel lazy—but repeated listens suggest that these are simply Verbilla’s mantras on humanity and mortality. The more hurt she reveals (“Another trauma I’ll have to unpack,” she wails in “Burden”), the more weight her duplicated words bear.While Verbilla finds strength in this poetry, she’s yet to hit her stride as a musician. “Best Laid Plans” and “The City’s Our Song” boast her boldest, most dynamic choruses, but few moments are equal to them. Compositionally, Make Yourself at Home is rather simple: There are more power chords than intricate riffs, and most of the hooks are a little too banal to stick. It’s easy to wish there was something more complex in the music of Harmony Woods—but after you hear Verbilla’s narratives, it’s also pretty easy to forgive her.",2019-10-05,6.5
Angel Olsen,All Mirrors,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","Angel Olsen is a natural at writing mantras for jaded souls. Burn your fire for no witness. Unfucktheworld. Some days all you need is one good thought strong in your mind. No one’s gonna hear it the same as it’s said. While her music has evolved from lamp-lit folk to boisterous rock’n’roll and ritzy synth-pop, she has always emphasized the importance of self-conviction. This steadfast philosophy, coupled with how wryly she appears to withstand heavy emotional weather, has made Olsen talismanic to fans. But halfway through the tour for her 2016 album My Woman, a messy fallout from a breakup made Olsen realize how disconnected she had become from herself. She decided to make her next album as she had her earliest releases, working almost alone (in remote Anacortes, Washington) to focus on bare-bones songwriting. It also meant trying to elude the accrued weight of her identity: Olsen has said that she and her friends often “joke about how dumb ‘Angel Olsen’ is.”In the songs Olsen wrote in Anacortes, love and, consequently, her identity became an illusion. What ended up on her fifth album, All Mirrors, are bemused questions about why she would suppress her needs, why she had to deny what she was going through, why the past must keep repeating. The lyrics are often softer and less certain than on her first four scalpel-sharp records. If there is one mantra among them, it’s in the stoned ambivalence of “Spring”: “I’m beginning to wonder if anything’s real,” she sings. “Guess we’re just at the mercy of the way that we feel.”We don’t yet know what the music from those Anacortes sessions sounds like: A few months after its completion, Olsen recorded a second version of the album with show-stopping string arrangements from Ben Babbitt and Jherek Bischoff (and production by John Congleton). She intended to release both records simultaneously, then realized the power of the orchestrated version meant it had to come first. The two incarnations, one lavish and one threadbare, embody that lyric about how feelings shape reality and identity, and pose a striking challenge from an artist variously misunderstood in the past as “sad girl at the bottom of a well,” feminist autodidact, and silver wig-wearing “character.”Once both takes on All Mirrors stand side by side, they’ll offer an intriguing case study in interpretation and how form suggests content: Is authenticity regarded as a magisterial group effort or just a lone voice and a guitar? Does devastation hit harder at volume or a whisper? The two albums are also a massive, meta juxtaposition of the feminine archetypes that Olsen has wielded over the past decade—fragility and excess, interiority and high drama, submission and rage—that dares us to distinguish between the person and the performance.For now, though, all we have is the first part, which would be revelatory in any context. The atmosphere suggests a wracked Cassavetes heroine wandering onto a sparkling MGM set and sinking right into its whipped-cream luxe. Eight of its 11 songs feature a 12-piece string section, with modes ranging from gallant high-romance to Gainsbourg hat-tips to twilit softness. Plenty of acts skew symphonic at some point in their career, and it’s hard for any artist to hold their own against such overwhelming staging and the constant threat of pastiche. But everything from the songs’ surprising dramatic arcs to their granular textures feels integral to Olsen’s songwriting. Take the title track, where she sings about being trapped by her past romances and youthful beauty: The backmasked backing vocals intensify that sense of imprisonment; the synth sparkle that follows it takes an unexpected dip from major to minor, like a sudden changing of the light. And that moment in “Spring” where she sings about being at the mercy of her feelings pushes the song from twinkling lullaby to barbiturate reverie, a total surrender to sensation on a record so recklessly physical it should come with its own parachute.Not that All Mirrors is just a strong wind that blows in and leaves you undone. Olsen has described All Mirrors as an “angry” record, and even when she isn’t explicitly cursing “DREAM ON DREAM ON DREAM ON” on the skyrocketing “Lark” at an ex who failed to register her desires, the synth-abetted production seethes and shudders, grandeur and ruin existing side by side. But it’s a playful album, too, one that traces the full scope of heartbreak. “What It Is” canters along as Olsen mocks herself for giving in to love’s charade: “You just wanted to forget/That your heart was full of shit!” she sings in a cadence that suggests a sarcastically wagged finger. With its elongated violin notes, “Tonight” is fit for the last flush of romance in a silver-screen love story.Yet Olsen’s tenderness is directed at herself, having arrived at a clarity where she no longer cares to explain “all the things you think you’ve come to understand about me.” Her composure as she sings these words is as still and inky as the sea against the night sky. The remark could apply just as much to the public as her former lover. Each of Olsen’s artistic developments has been heralded as some sort of permanent shift in her work or her commercial aspirations: Now she’s an indie star. Now she wants to be a pop star. Oh, she’s collaborating with Mark Ronson? She must really want to be a pop star. But the wild range of All Mirrors and Olsen’s vocal performance fly in the face of the idea that identity and artistry are fixed, and consequently turn over how much we can ever know each other, and ourselves.She finds the nuance and enduring pleasure in her game of faces. While “Too Easy” sends up undying devotion, with moony girl-groupisms to spare, Olsen willfully dedicates herself to someone else on “New Love Cassette”—and the lusty mood, lifted directly from Gainsbourg’s 1971 album L’Histoire de Melody Nelson, indicates her pleasure in doing so. We fall in love again and again because a little self-sabotage never stopped anyone. Olsen suggests that nihilism and optimism are closer than you think, that what feels like knowing yourself is almost always revealed as delusion. On All Mirrors, she glories in that tumult, and the sparks that fly illuminate her bravura turn.Buy: Rough Trade / Vinyl Me, Please(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-04,8.9
Sui Zhen,"Losing, Linda","<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=electronic"">Electronic</a>","The idea of human consciousness existing outside the body has been the focus of dystopian sci-fi from Blade Runner to Westworld, and it’s embedded in the new album from Melbourne art-pop auteur Becky Freeman—a.k.a. Sui Zhen. But unlike those works, Losing, Linda isn’t consumed by apocalyptic visions of robots taking over. Rather, the record suggests there’s something inherently flawed about attempting to live in a perfect world, and that there are certain problems for which there is no app.Freeman's sublime sophomore effort, 2015’s Secretly Susan, explored a life lived through avatars. On Losing, Linda, Freeman sings from the perspective of the titular AI Linda. The lyrics examine the possibility of artificially reconstructing a human life through the digital detritus we leave behind on social media—an idea that became all-consuming when Freeman’s mother was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer just as recording commenced.  And like the latex-mask replica of her face that she wears on the cover, the results are equally alluring and unnerving—this is a record where pristine facades can never conceal the distressed soul underneath.Losing, Linda hits the same big pleasure points as Secretly Susan—neon-hued ’80s pop, DIY digital dub, bossa-nova balladry—but the mood hovers between ecstasy and unease. Freeman’s voice loses the post-Grimes avant-R&B smear of Secretly Susan, adopting an eerily calm and crystal-clear diction that sounds very much like an AI learning to convincingly imitate us. The drum-machine stutters of “Natural Progression” suggest a robot coming to life and getting used to its mechanical limbs, before asking itself questions like: “I’m growing hair/Do I need it anymore?”On the centerpiece “Being a Woman,” Freeman’s concerns move beyond physical characteristics to the gender expectations accompanying them. The song is both celebratory and cautionary, a proud declaration of womanhood on one’s own terms (“Redefine sexuality, that’s how I’ll find my way!”) whose chorus (“Being a woman/You have to hold yourself ... before you hold someone else”) suggests self-determination is much easier wished for than achieved. Freeman recently admitted that she was only able to be open about her sexuality after her mother passed, so when she sings “When I grew up, I thought I had to be/Somebody’s mother, or somebody’s daughter,” she hints at the unshakable familial forces that can constrain even the most empowered, free-thinking souls.On Losing, Linda, her mother's loss isn’t so much addressed as felt. You can hear it in the ghostly chorus to the space-age bachelor-pad sway of “I Could Be There,” in the eerie Dark Side of the Moon Safari atmosphere of “Another Life,” or in the equally desolate and divine dream-pop of “Mountain Song.” The latter track was inspired a treacherous hike that left Freeman stranded for a night atop a Japanese mountain, though with lines like “Can you let go and just be comfortable with the fear you have for the unknown/What could be out there that’s scarier than your own mind,” she seems to be preparing herself for the even greater challenge that awaits her once she returns to her mother’s bedside. But on “Different Places,” she seems to make peace with the fact that her life will henceforth be haunted by absence: “We’re just in different places,” she sings, before adding, “but I’m with you.”As Losing, Linda reminds us, the cruel irony about technology is that we crave its synthetic pleasures in those moments when life gets too real. But with the immaculate “Perfect Place”—a sensuous swirl of Neal Tennant sing-speak, Kraftwerk keyboards, and rubbery funk bass—Freeman suggests that utopia can be ours not with the push of a button, but with a boost in motivation and change of scene. “Now look toward the river/A new point of view/Past the industry/A little further still/ And it’s the perfect place—get to know it,” she sings, like an enlightened Waze app. ”Things you can’t put off, do it now, do it now.” By adopting a robotic persona to examine real-life strife, she reinforces the notion that a life is more than just an accumulation of data.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-04,8.0
Boris,LφVE & EVφL,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=metal"">Metal</a>","New Boris albums once offered joyous upheaval and a sense of shock. At their best, and sometimes their worst, they ventured into whatever forms fit their loose-fitting creed of “Heavy Rocks.” Pink, one of the band’s early, essential breakthroughs, moved from the reinvented shoegaze anthem “Farewell” into wild-eyed D-Beat and squalid noise-rock, as if beating a gleeful retreat from perfection. Sure, there have been gimmicks and missteps along the way, but Boris’ restlessness has often been rewarding and contagious.But it is hard to muster much more than a shrug for LØVE & EVØL, Boris’ double-album debut for Jack White’s Third Man Records. LØVE & EVØL finds Boris at a strange career crossroads—or, rather, just beyond it. Three years ago, they recorded what was meant to be their farewell album but instead stumbled into Dear, their most ecstatic and aggressive LP in years. Boris sounded reborn, their vows renewed. LØVE & EVØL, however, suggests that the euphoria of this second honeymoon has faded. These seven anemic songs find Boris becoming something new yet again—self-satisfied.They remind us of a lot of their best tricks: Wata’s solos, like the one that leads the lumbering “LOVE” out of its torpor, still streak across these tracks like a rainbow somehow appearing against a moonless night sky—few guitarists sound so rapturous with a trick so simple. And in its ascendant second half, “EVOL” recreates the band’s most disorienting and beautiful effect—the ability to drop down in tempo, key, and distortion and still shoot for the stars, as if the rules of gravity have been temporarily reversed.Those little moments of wonder stud songs that, by and large, feel like adult-coloring-book versions of Boris triumphs past. “uzume” is a surging wall of noise, with wave after wave of distortion and drums moving ever inward, but it lacks the wild radiance of their earlier drone experiments. Closer “Shadow of Skulls” lingers in the same space for 12 minutes without shifting into anything heavenly or heavy. It plods ever-onward because Boris don’t know what else to do with it—a fitting end for an album that adds little but another entry into an already-enormous catalogueThe band once served as a generational gateway to the worlds of international psychedelia and doom-adjacent metal. Accessible and enigmatic, they drew you in, making you sort through alternate editions of their records to find the next weird gem. But accessing the world’s musical extremes is easier than it was even a decade ago, with point-and-click access to infinite wormholes. Boris, meanwhile, simply feel staid, a band that missed its best chance to take a bow.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-04,5.8
Red River Dialect,Abundance Welcoming Ghosts,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","Midway through “Salvation,” Red River Dialect’s headlong foray into psychedelic folk-rock, David Morris yelps out the words, “Iced coffee brain freeze!” It’s an odd moment, marrying a mundane idea with swirling fiddle and a relentless wah-wah guitar, and for that reason alone it could be easily parodied. It’s also a captivating moment, one that anchors the song’s loftier subjects to the everyday world and reveals something essential about Morris as a songwriter and bandleader. Red River Dialect are fascinated by tactile sensations, whether it’s the sharpness of hot metal against your hand or the soft tension of a piano key under your finger. When Morris shouts about brain freeze, you hear the band work together to evoke the chilly stab of adrenaline.Such physical sensations are important, as they ground the earnest spiritual inquiries animating the Cornwall band’s inventive folk-rock songs. Morris is the son of an Anglican priest; as a teenager he found Buddhism through the Beat poets and went on to work as an interfaith adviser at the University of Westminster in London. Immediately following the sessions for Abundance Welcoming Ghosts, Red River Dialect’s fifth album, he decamped to Nova Scotia for a nine-month stay at Gampo Abbey. The music and the monastery visit may serve the same purpose, as Morris has regularly seeded Red River Dialect songs with spiritual insights and observations. “May I welcome joy when it comes near,” he sings on the jazzy, Pentangular “My Friend.” “May I also laugh about but never doubt it.” There’s a quiver in his voice, slightly more suppressed here than on previous records, that makes the lines sound less like lessons and more like reminders to himself.Perhaps because the band knew Morris was going to disappear for close to a year, or perhaps because they spent so much time touring behind 2018’s Broken Stay Open Sky, these songs possess a new urgency and intensity. There’s an electric tension to “Blue Sparks,” with piano notes that sound like the hooves of a galloping horse. Even a slower, quieter tune like “Two White Carp” sounds barely contained, as though the players might burst out of the Welsh landscape as Morris paints it. In the tradition of Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span, who mixed traditional English folk songs with contemporary rock sounds, Red River Dialect understand the importance of a solid rhythm section: Drummer Kiran Bhatt and bassist Coral Kindred-Boothby play with a jazzy sense of invention that makes “Snowdon” sound like it’s powered by an invisible engine.Abundance Welcoming Ghosts may be the band’s most ingenious and immersive mix of folk and rock yet, but it’s also Morris’ most compelling set of songs. He invests small sensations with outsize power, finding joy in sensory pleasures as well as in the mystical inquests that music allows. “Oh, a piano,” he sings on “Piano.” “Open the lid, play a single note, and look out through a new window.” Even as the record is steeped in the long history of British folk music, that balance of the tactile and the spiritual anchors these songs in the present moment.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-04,7.7
Young M.A,Herstory in the Making,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rap"">Rap</a>","In the immediate wake of the viral 2016 hit “OOOUUU,” Young M.A was quickly projected to be a trailblazer for modern New York City rap, pegged as a rejuvenator for quintessential New York City rap, and preordained as the city’s best pure rapper in what had felt like ages. She was the hottest rapper of the moment, maybe the most promising hometown prospect since 50 Cent, and even he was impressed.Usually, all stories of viral rap success play out in the same way—a label swoops in after a bidding war, new music is released posthaste, and most of it sounds dangerously close to the viral hit itself. But something funny happened with M.A: She never signed with a major, she held off on rushing out an album, and she retreated deeper into her notepad, not once trying to recreate her signature song. Without much of an attempt to capitalize on her virality, the hype subsided, and many wrote Young M.A off as a flash in the pan. In a twist, in the years since, she has quietly lived up to everything unfairly foisted upon her.Young M.A isn’t just one of the best rappers in her city, she’s one of the best anywhere. She has spent her free moments, during on-air appearances or hijacking other rapper’s songs, putting beats through the torture rack until she’s cracked them. Though a longtime master of the form, her freestyles have become epics. Her singles have become confessionals. In these structureless spaces, she’s unleashed. Her verses feel undiluted and ceaseless; she seems inexhaustible, like she could rap forever. Herstory in the Making, her long-awaited debut album, was supposed to be a punctuation mark. It was meant to put a cap on this arc, to give shape to her untreated verses and her story. Instead, it is merely another flex, another display of her competence and skill. She runs the gauntlet and comes out largely unscathed.A name like Herstory in the Making implies biography and Young M.A has confirmed as much in interviews. She always seems to be setting the record straight in her raps, but these aren’t her memoirs. In an attempt to offer all of herself, she ends up providing only glimpses, never settling long enough to divulge much. Despite that, she finds enough balance to provide a convincing self-portrait. There is plenty of the tough M.A—the raw M.A—to satiate fans of her bruiser raps, especially on bum-rushing songs like “No Mercy” and “Bleed,” but there is vulnerability elsewhere. The NY Bangers-produced “Sober Thoughts” reveals struggles with depression and substance abuse in the aftermath of her celebrity. When she lets her guard down, she grows as a storyteller.The most glaring illustration of this is “No Love,” on which Young M.A wrestles with her brother’s murder and her own proximity to street life. As the song goes on, she keeps reliving his death in different contexts, feeling its impact in different ways. It is some of her most centered writing. “I seen my brother go from human to Casper/From a bed to a casket/Tryna move on, but it’s like my life goin’ backwards,” she remembers, trapped in a nightmare. There’s no love in the streets so she finds it elsewhere—down a bottle of Hennessey, in her mother, and in God. She always raps with clarity, but when she writes with purpose her songs become even more affecting. Sometimes, the writing is so crisp that it becomes like journaling in its detail and narrative focus. “My paychecks use to be a pair of Jordans/And I know I can’t afford ’em, but I went ahead and bought ’em/Then I quit, started slangin’, spent my money on recordin’/Yeah, the studio was small, but man, that shit made me a fortune,” she raps on “Car Confessions,” as clear a rendering of converting aspiration into inspiration as you’ll ever hear.There is such a natural finesse and composure to M.A’s rapping that it can, at times, seem almost casual. But it’s easy to underestimate what’s happening on Herstory in the Making because she performs a rap clinic for nearly 70 minutes without exerting much energy. While the album may not be the resounding statement of self the title makes it out to be, it is a fine endorsement of everything that those who have ignored her have been missing. If nothing else, Herstory in the Making is an exhibition of Young M.A’s ability to rap proficiently over anything. She bobs her way through the muted, glowing Mike Zombie-produced “BIG” and then lurches through Zaytoven’s trap gospel on “Kold World” like Peak Gucci Mane. She slides off the “My Hitta” synths with singsong flows. With each song on her debut, Young M.A is reasserting her place in rap.",2019-10-03,7.3
The Comet Is Coming,The Afterlife,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=jazz"">Jazz</a>","Since their debut was shortlisted for the Mercury Prize in 2016, the Comet is Coming’s saxophonist Shabaka Hutchings has become a formidable presence in the international jazz scene in his own right, making fans of Beyoncé and Virgil Abloh along the way. Hutchings landed not just one but three different bands on the Impulse label in the process. From the Afro-Caribbean stomp of his Sons of Kemet to the South African spiritual jazz of Shabaka and the Ancestors, his music is simultaneously rooted in the traditional, broadly international in scope, and thoroughly of the moment.But there’s something in the way the Comet Is Coming skewers the typical jazz trio that stands apart from his other projects. Its surface speaks to the cosmic sounds of Sun Ra, but there’s something raw and earthy at the core. Comet draw from the minimal, restrained palette of the trio format to make something that’s electrifying and apocalyptic all at once, able to tear the roof of jazz—as well as rock, jam band, and EDM—festivals. A companion piece to this year’s Trust in the Lifeforce of the Deep Mystery, The Afterlife continues to hover over that album’s scorched earth, not replicating the rush of “Summon the Fire” but instead exploring in greater detail that set’s most somber moments. It’s concise yet also shows the trio’s depth in just over 30 minutes.Whereas Trust in the Lifeforce’s centerpiece featured the poet Kate Tempest speaking vitriolically of capitalism and “the blood of the past,” here the band welcomes back to the fold Joshua Idehen. Idehen appeared on Sons of Kemet’s Impulse debut and previous Comet albums, most tellingly on “The Final Days of the Apocalypse.” His dystopian demeanor remains unchanged on opener “All That Matters Is the Moments,” spitting lines of “daydreaming of a world I won’t live to see” against a slow roil of drums and widening oscillations. There are glints of clarity, at least, if not hope, as he speaks of holding onto the memories of friendships in trying times.No matter the cosmic jazz or sci-fi backdrop conjured, Hutchings knows when to ride the carefully controlled swells of drummer Max “Betamax” Hallett and synth player Dan “Danalogue” Leavers and when to rove on his own. He lays in the cut on the beautiful “The Softness of the Present,” basking in warm chords laid down by Leavers and the chunky beat of Hallett, adding just enough vibrato to keep the piece from drifting off into downtempo territory. Instead, the songs drifts into the title track, which strikes a deft balance between menacing sine waves and the kind of gurgling ostinatos that Alice Coltrane would throw down on her organ. “The Seven Planetary Heavens” deftly blends the breathy air of spiritual jazz with the pinging of techno to make something that, instead of reaching the point of combustion, maintains a radiant glow.Divorced from the flickering electronics and rolling drums, Hutchings’ burnished horn would sound merely soulful, as it is on the two-part “Lifeforce.” But combined with the arpeggios and simmering cymbals, his tone veers towards the melancholic, as if moving over a planet’s surface in search of life. In the song’s second half, as Hallett’s chunky breaks transition towards something more uplifting, Hutchings’ horn picks up enough velocity that the trio achieves liftoff, no doubt to some other unexplored corner of the cosmos.",2019-10-03,7.6
Gong,Love From the Planet Gong: The Virgin Years 1973-75,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","If Daevid Allen’s prophecy is correct, we are a mere 13 years away from Planet Gong descending from the heavens to deliver enlightenment to all earthlings. Allen first posited his theory on a series of albums by Gong in the mid-1970s: Each LP was designed, he said, to prepare “the heads of all who hear their music for the arrival in the year 2032 of many Pot Head Pixies who will be coming to help spread of joy in the new age.” Those albums, long known among the Gong cognoscenti as The Radio Gnome Trilogy, are housed alongside a bounty of unreleased live material excavated from deep in the Virgin Records vaults in the hefty Love From the Planet Gong: The Virgin Years 1973-75, a 12-CD/1-DVD box set whose very weight may intimidate anyone who is not already a member of the band’s dedicated cult.Gong tended to attract cultists, in every sense of the word. Freaks of all stripes flocked to Allen, hearing loopy wisdom lying underneath Gong’s cacophonic prog-funk fusion, ever-expanding space-rock, and tall tales of spliff-toking sprites. The most famous of these fans was Sherman Hemsley, who gained notoriety as George Jefferson on the Norman Lear sitcom The Jeffersons. At the height of his fame in the late 1970s, Hemsley flew Allen out to his Los Angeles home, where the Gong guitarist discovered a chamber devoted to his band. Flying Teapot—the first installment of The Radio Gnome Trilogy, released in 1973—played on a loop in a darkened room filled with naked women, and that was just the tip of the actor’s devotion. Hemsley planned to wallpaper Hollywood with billboards trumpeting Flying Teapot, in hopes of spreading the Planet Gong philosophy to the masses. Gong’s music inspires this intense dedication but also its opposite reaction: To those on the outside, the fantastical music-hall jazz sounds utterly bewildering.If Gong seem as if they flew in from another world, there is some truth in that suspicion; they were born in the serene surroundings of the French countryside. As a member of the pioneering psych-jazz outfit Soft Machine, the Australian-born Allen was part of Canterbury’s nascent prog-rock scene in the late 1960s, but once the band’s 1967 European tour wrapped up, the UK denied him reentry due to an overextended visa. Undaunted, Allen claimed Paris as his new home, witnessing the student revolution of 1968 before eventually settling on the edge of a forest with his partner Gilli Smyth. Before long, the pair formed Gong, which from their earliest days defied anything resembling a stable lineup. Musicians would come and go, usually living in the band’s communal house in Voisines. Allen wasn’t so much the leader of the bunch as he was its shepherd, encouraging his flock to follow his path but happy to take whatever detours the pack pursued.A few Gong records came out on the French label BYG in the early 1970s, but the three years the group spent at Virgin is where they took flight. Happily, they inked a deal with the fledgling Virgin Records when Richard Branson was flush with cash and willing to let his acts do whatever they wanted. Along with Mike Oldfield, whose “Tubular Bells” became a massive hit thanks to its prominent placement in The Exorcist, Gong were Virgin’s signature act. Flying Teapot, largely recorded prior to the Virgin deal, didn’t quite take full advantage of this freedom, yet it still shows the band taking shape. It’s a technicolor blimp that lurches and glides, cruising along on dextrous funk fusion before it descends into annoying maniacal chants. Chalk the latter up to the pothead pixies, who were central to Allens’ “Gong philosophy,” which wasn’t so much a cohesive manifesto but a feverish prankster fantasy filled with cheap puns, smutty jokes, and a fervent belief in cosmic unity.All those elements gel on Angel’s Egg, a 1973 LP that Gong recorded at their country home, miking the woods for ambiance. The crackpot idea worked. Gong sound utterly unencumbered by gravity, floating between moments of grace and madness. Again, much of that lunacy comes from Allen’s mythology, which picked up themes and the thinnest of narrative threads from Flying Teapot, then turns it into a jumble that’s indecipherable without bushels of weed.Paradise eventually comes to an end, and so it was with Gong. A bust—equal parts customs and drugs violations—prompted France to kick the group out of the country, so they headed to England and gathered the material for 1974’s You, which was their biggest, boldest album. Nominally the conclusion of The Radio Gnome Trilogy, You found Allen’s Gong philosophy slowly subsumed by the majestic power of the band. In a sense, they achieved an equilibrium, with the band—now featuring the liquid, startling guitar of Steve Hillage—racing along at the same speed of Allen’s mind, while his lunacy prevented the knotty extended improvisations from calcifying into egghead art.The divide between Allen and much of the rest of Gong came to a head in 1975. At a concert, Allen claimed “a force-field stopped me taking the stage on my musical cue,” so he simply left the band he created. Some members quit in his wake, while others were relieved to see him go: Drummer Pierre Moerlen and percussionist Mireille Bauer were eager to ditch the “silly lyrics” and overhauled the group into a slick, serious outfit that could hold its own with Weather Report. That incarnation of Gong can be heard on 1976’s Shamal, the last of the four studio albums included on Love From the Planet Gong. It’s an impressive work, sharing a clear lineage with the nimble jazz-funk of the preceding three albums, but neither Shamal nor the post-Allen live concert from 1975 quite feels like Gong. Without Allen’s babble, the band lacked the means of achieving transcendence.Not that Gong often did that anyway. Most of the time, the band was working at cross purposes, a tension that is maddening and thrilling in equal measure. In the studio, these tendencies were gussied up, often in an appealing fashion, but the live recordings that provide the bulk of the unreleased material on Love From the Planet Gong show the band’s muscle and might at work. Stripped of the stage visuals—their act was replete with mime, sorcerer hats, ultraviolet lights, and paper plates doubling as flying saucers—the group is an unwieldy delight: a British Sun Ra Arkestra that manages to make it home in time for tea.The live recordings are bracing and, oddly enough, they provide a better gateway to understanding Gong than the albums themselves, as the LPs often are dressed in fussy period charms. Returning to the studio trilogy after absorbing the live recordings, Flying Teapot, Angel’s Egg, and You seem like vivid snapshots of songs that are often too wild to sit still. Gong’s restlessness is integral to their appeal, since it’s what pushed them to explore the outer reaches of the universe from the confines of a French country home. The group managed to create an enduringly weird body of work whose strength is perhaps best appreciated in total, not in parts. Taken individually, or without the concert recordings, the LPs seem merely odd, but when they’re combined as they are in this box, the strangeness seems monumental. And that’s fitting a testament to Gong: They’re not a band designed for dabbling, only a full immersion will do.",2019-10-03,7.7
Hiss Golden Messenger,Terms of Surrender,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=folk"">Folk/Country</a>","The phrase “terms of surrender” implies defeat, but surrender can mean also liberation. On his fourth album for Merge Records, Hiss Golden Messenger’s M.C. Taylor splits the difference between the two meanings of the phrase as he tries to make sense of his own increasingly complicated life. Working within his established roots-rock sound, he explores the heaviest questions—how to be an artist, a parent, a citizen—and realizes that there may be fewer and fewer answers as the years go by.To do so, he enlists two big-name indie-rock guests: the National’s Aaron Dessner contributes guitar and piano, and Jenny Lewis sings backing vocals. But a quieter fact of Terms of Surrender is that the album has no involvement from Scott Hirsch. A longtime collaborator going back to pre-Hiss bands the Court & Spark and Ex Ignota, Hirsch has produced, engineered, and/or played on almost every Hiss Golden Messenger album. His unusual bass patterns helped lock the band into its distinct grooves; his production felt spacious without being sparse. Without him, an intangible element of Hiss’ “secret sauce” has disappeared.Instead, Brad Cook—former Megafaun bassist and collaborator with acts like Bon Iver, Whitney, and Kevin Morby—handles both bass and production, and fills the frame with ill-fitting sounds as if over-compensating. The album isn’t a mess, per se, but it is cluttered, and it often feels like Cook should’ve adhered to Coco Chanel’s rule of removing one thing before leaving the house. There are just too many elements competing for space, and none of them seem to agree which is the star.Hiss Golden Messenger have dipped into dub textures before (2009’s “O Nathaniel,” 2012’s “Born on a Crescent Moon”) and they do so again on Surrender’s “Old Enough to Wonder Why (East Side—West Side).” But then tinny banjo plunks appear like gnats, disrupting the wide-open sense of space. Taylor’s voice, meanwhile, feels squished among layers of guitars, keys, and synths. At times, it’s difficult to make out what he’s singing—a shame, as Taylor has a knack for examining existential anxiety with honesty and empathy. On the sweeping opener “I Need a Teacher,” Taylor yearns for “beauty in the broken American moment.” With “Happy Birthday Baby,” a tender song written for his young daughter, he hopes she’ll think better of him than he does of himself.But the arrangements of songs like “Down at the Uptown” and “Katy (You Don’t Have to Be Good Yet)” feel more in service to broad-strokes Dead-and-Dylan worship than to Taylor’s songwriting. A striking line like, “I’m a little bit lost and a whole lot of things you can’t hang with” gets lost in the anodyne folk-rock mix. Sometimes, Taylor’s lyrics seem to arrive from an entirely different record, one that’s better and more focused. His best songs put his ruminations on spirituality, family, loneliness, and humanity at the center, but here he sounds like the only thing he’s surrendered is his spotlight.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-03,6.5
DaBaby,KIRK,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rap"">Rap</a>","DaBaby hasn’t turned down a check since the Fourth of July. On that night, Dreamville debuted “Under the Sun,” a record that features the Charlotte, North Carolina rapper sounding like a local drug dealer that found God. Since that moment, nearly every pop-rap hit has gotten the DaBaby touch. This summer alone, the 27-year-old landed on tracks from Chance The Rapper, Lizzo, Lil Nas X, and Post Malone. In return, DaBaby, who a year ago was stuck in regional-rap-star purgatory, has become one of rap’s most visible stars.With that visibility has come slight DaBaby fatigue; constant exposure to his breathless, high-energy flow will do that. Beginning with March’s Baby on Baby, DaBaby has flooded the internet with different iterations of the same song—you know the one. But it’s important that we note: DaBaby is really good at making that one song.In DaBaby’s six months or so as a pop-culture figure, one thing that we know for sure is that he likes to rap. Like, really rap. He’s not spitting traditional lyrical-miracle 16s, but he is joyfully filling up every inch of available space, and on KIRK, R&B hooks and sing-rap harmonies are an afterthought. His rapping is relentless, and he doesn’t ride a beat so much as he steamrolls it.KIRK offers some moments of unexpected depth. On “Intro,” he reveals that he learned “Suge” went No. 1 on Billboard’s mainstream R&B/hip-hop charts the same day he learned of his father’s sudden death. “Same time I got the news, my shit went number one, that’s fucked up,” he says, over a warm instrumental that sounds like it was made in a hip church’s Sunday school. For the first time, he effectively works an emotion besides “I will punch you in the face” into his formula, and it fits him surprisingly well.DaBaby doesn’t stay in the reflective mindstate for long, though. After he pays respects to his father and comes to terms with his own trauma, he’s back making the sort of music that I imagine plays in his head while he punches a showgoer mid-bar and throws hands at the mall. On “Off The Rip,” DaBaby raps about eating at a restaurant with his kids and mother with the same chaotic spirit he brings to verses about robbing local drug dealers. DaBaby is self-aware, which goes a long way in hip-hop. He goes in over bass-heavy beats that are similar, but not the same, most notably from homegrown Carolina producer Jetsonmade. “Straight off the rip, you know I don’t wait for the drop,” he says, commenting on his penchant for rapping at the 0:01 timestamp.KIRK’s momentum is disrupted by the number of guests that can’t hang with DaBaby (See: Nicki Minaj and Migos). DaBaby’s similarly anarchic long-time partner Stunna 4 Vegas and Kevin Gates are the lone guests that sound at home—which makes sense considering that Gates’ deadpan delivery has probably influenced DaBaby. But much of KIRK is DaBaby in his sweet spot: alone and rapping with the untamed aggression of a tasmanian devil, on a beat that could destroy a 2001 Toyota Corolla from the inside out if played too loud. Change is overrated.",2019-10-02,7.6
Tyshawn Sorey,The Adornment of Time,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=jazz"">Jazz</a>","The composer and multi-instrumentalist Tyshawn Sorey has been spoiling audiences in a variety of jazz and classical scenes over the last few years. It’s easy to assume that he’s always in a recording studio somewhere: documenting his excellent trio; working as a percussionist in bands led by colleagues like Vijay Iyer and Steve Lehman; producing expansive, multi-hour pieces that engage with drone-music mysticism. But that substantial discography is hardly the whole story.His recent song cycle, “Cycles of My Being,” was written for the tenor Lawrence Brownlee (and has played at Carnegie Hall and Opera Philadelphia). A 2018 appearance at New York’s Jazz Gallery, during which Sorey performed on a modified piano alongside the saxophonist Hafez Modirzadeh, was a reminder that his work as a keyboardist has not been given enough attention. A few months later, a production of Sorey’s dramatic work inspired by Josephine Baker, with a text by Claudia Rankine, proved mesmerizing on the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s grand staircase.Yet even as his reach has broadened, Sorey has also kept working in more intimate formats. His latest record, a duo set with the veteran pianist Marilyn Crispell, is a freely improvised meeting recorded live at the Kitchen, a longtime New York experimental haven.The album’s first act—particularly its first 20 minutes—is dominated by hushed and haunted timbres from both players. Approximately half an hour in, we get the first hint of tumult, a mood that develops, thrashes around, crests, and subsides over another quarter hour. An extended, closing coda brings to mind the beginning section while also highlighting the distance these performers have traveled.On the surface, this might seem a standard free-improv sequence, and therefore less notable than Sorey’s hyper-conceptual projects. But this composer lives to mess with surface-level thinking. And thanks to his distaste for categorizing music—particularly when it comes to genre definitions—listeners should always be prepared for ambition and thoughtfulness, no matter the format.Not surprisingly, across this unbroken 64-minute improvisation Crispell proves to be an ideal partner for such a non-hierarchical musical mind. Her own rise to prominence came, during the 1980s, as the pianist in saxophonist and composer Anthony Braxton’s “classic” quartet (a group whose recordings Sorey remembers admiring as a teen in the liner notes for this album).During those vintage, marathon performances, preserved on albums like Quartet (Birmingham) 1985, Crispell often played one of Braxton’s notated solo-piano pieces while the band’s other members played parts from other Braxton works. The collage-style results tended to be bracing, but always in a musical fashion—in part due to Crispell’s keen ability for listening intently amid a whirlwind.Crispell’s responsiveness is still in elite, extraordinary shape here. Her percussive, avant-jazz technique gets plenty of room to roam during a section of high-drama pummeling; check out the swinging density she produces 34 minutes into the set.But her feel for momentum is also present during many of the performance's quieter passages, during which the pianist’s ideas clearly inspire choices made by the drummer. (It helps that Sorey’s kit is outfitted with gongs and other forms of pitched percussion, the better to merge with melodies coming from Crispell’s instrument.) In these moments, The Adornment of Time doesn’t merely present two talented musicians in a room, improvising at the same time. Instead, the album makes good on ideals at the heart of the free-improv tradition—including equality and adaptiveness—that are often paid lip service, if not always easily heard.",2019-10-02,8.0
The New Pornographers,In the Morse Code of Brake Lights,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","Ever since Chuck Berry motorvated over the hill in “Maybellene,” cars have been a shorthand for freedom in rock’n’roll. The New Pornographers flip this axiom on its head on their eighth album, In the Morse Code of Brake Lights, where all sense of liberation is undercut by a suspicion that whoever is behind the wheel may be headed toward danger.A sense of doom lurks at the heart of Brake Lights, providing connective tissue between its 11 barbed songs and darkening the album’s sunniest moments. As the work of a collective determined to keep classic guitar-pop alive by slyly twisting and expanding the form, Brake Lights has no shortage of colorful melodies, yet the hooks rarely feel bright, certainly not when compared to the incandescent rush of 2017’s Whiteout Conditions.Such a shift in tone is deliberate, a reflection of changes within the New Pornographers as well as the culture at large. Always the group’s unofficial leader, A.C. Newman now stands as its lone songwriter and producer. Busy with family obligations, bassist John Collins decided not to share production duties with Newman this time around, while the mercurial Dan Bejar opted to sit out, save a lyric or two. Bejar’s absence has the inevitable side effect of straightening out the group’s sound, but the bigger change on Brake Lights lies in the New Pornographers’ retreat from the bombast of 2014’s Brill Bruisers and the percolating Krautrock rhythms and New Wave sheen of Whiteout Conditions. Stripped of such excesses, the band seems harder and tougher than they have in a while, maybe since the days of Twin Cinema.A lot has changed since 2005, not the least being a global political lurch toward the right. Newman appears to address the turmoil of Trump’s America throughout Brake Lights: The narrator of “Colossus of Rhodes” sorts through the wreckage of a break-in but still believes in salvation; “Higher Beam” laments that “deep in the culture of fear, we all hate living here”; references to dead malls and cold wars are rampant. Despite these charged phrases, it’s difficult to discern any distinct political position in these songs, because Newman resists concrete narratives. Words pile upon each other, slowing down just enough to allow a certain line to linger; it’s as if he’s writing puzzles to counteract the force of his melodies.Perhaps Newman’s lyrics are elusive, but enough images catch hold to create a lasting impression. In the Morse Code of Brake Lights feels emotionally direct in a way that’s foreign to New Pornographers, the result of Newman stripping the group down to its foundation and then building back up with the assistance of the string quartet Strength of Materials. When the guitar amps are cranked, it sometimes can be difficult to distinguish the sawing strings from analog synthesizers, but that only emphasizes how densely saturated the album is. The songs are propelled by a giant backbeat and sustained by soaring melodies, but they’re surrounded by a cavalcade of echoing harmonies, carnivalesque keyboards and, on occasion, a ripe guitar riff.At the center of all the tumult is A.C. Newman and Neko Case, the pair who have wound up as the New Pornographers’ joint frontpeople. By now, their complementary styles are familiar—Case channels her passion with melodramatic flair, Newman is her wry, plaintive tonic—but far from tired. Each vocalist wrings out the confusion, desperation, and fear of the album’s darkest moments, adding shape and meaning to songs designed not to expose their secrets so easily. Case, in particular, has a knack for transforming elliptical tunes into urgent drama—in her hands, “Colossus of Rhodes” plays like an anthem—but Newman lends vulnerability to the delicate strains of “You Won’t Need Those Where You’re Going.” Still, what pulls the album into focus is their vocal interplay. Case and Newman trade lines, finish each other’s thoughts, reveal the unspoken meanings of the songs; they’re old friends who find sustenance in each other’s presence. The essential humanity at the heart of this relationship offsets the dread that flows throughout In the Morse Code of Brake Lights, and gently leads the record toward something resembling hope.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-02,7.4
Kevin Gates,I’M HIM,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rap"">Rap</a>","Somewhere along the way, Kevin Gates got buff. It wasn't a magical Gucci Mane transformation, but the once dad-bodded Louisiana rapper is now fit enough to be the subject of a Men’s Health video, where he outlined an exhaustive regime that includes rigorous dieting and 2 a.m. weight training. That same dedication he brings to working out—or to practicing oral sex on mangos, as he revealed when that Men’s Health segment inevitably took one of those weird, sexual turns that Gates always seems to invite—permeates just about everything he does, including his music.I'm Him is Gates’ official follow-up to his revelatory 2016 album Islah, although that ignores all the very good EPs and mixtapes he released in the interim. Parsing the distinction between albums and mixtapes is usually a fool’s errand, especially for an artist like Gates who mostly works without guest features, name producers, and other big-budget trappings. But I’m Him differentiates itself from his non-album releases in one key way: The hooks are magnificent, his most boisterous and fine-tuned since Islah.Lots of rappers sing, of course, but few seem to enjoy it as much as Gates. Even the most naturally tuneful SoundCloud rappers from the last few years sing as if out of solemn obligation. Gates bellows with a zeal rarely heard since Fetty Wap’s 2015 singles run; even when he's singing about pain and regret, he offers the go-for-broke gusto most of us save for a hot shower. “By My Lonely” runs a scant two minutes, but its hook is so monumental the track hits like an epic.Gates has carried a full-length project by himself before, but that doesn't make it any less remarkable hearing him do it again.  Seventeen songs with no guest features should be a recipe for exhaustion, yet there's hardly a trace of fat on I’m Him, and most tracks clock in at about the length of a Ramones song. “Push It” belongs in a Rocky montage, while “What I Like” pits Gates’ voice against a blown-out bass rumble. There are fewer sex songs on the album than usual, too, which is nice. Wonderful as it may be, Gates' voice is not the aphrodisiac he thinks it is.He includes two bravely sentimental standouts. “Betta For You” is an apology to the daughter he vows to do right by (“Your mother had you waterbirth and I skipped out, I was scared/I was afraid to be a failure, prayed my faith would prevail,”) while on “Fly Again’ he offers a grandiose love letter to his wife. “We the reciprocal of one another, come from the same star/We got the same moles under our nose and we got the same scars,” he raps, his voice dripping with sincerity.If I’m Him feels just a hair less essential than some of Gates’ previous releases, it’s because there isn’t all that much new to see. Gates folds a bit of DaBaby’s irritable yammer into his flow on “Facts” and on “Pretend” he flirts with a dancehall patois, both of which he more or less pulls off. But innovation has never been integral to a Kevin Gates project. The draw remains, as always, hearing one of rap’s most well-rounded personalities be his unabashed self, whether that means being a hardhead, a hornball, an unguarded romantic, or all of the above.",2019-10-02,7.4
Sturgill Simpson,SOUND & FURY,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=folk"">Folk/Country</a>","In 2017, Sturgill Simpson publicly declared that Nashville—every country musician’s master—does not dictate who he is or what his music sounds like. After his third studio album, A Sailor’s Guide to Earth, Simpson busked outside the 2017 Country Music Awards in protest of a statement CMA sent to journalists demanding they refrain from asking artists about the Las Vegas massacre, gun rights, or politics in general. One of the signs in his open guitar case read, mockingly, “Struggling country singer.” If the country music establishment didn’t feel he was fit for them, he’d show them that they were correct. He expands on this idea on SOUND & FURY, his fourth full-length, an extension of that protest in album—and anime—form. The album is the soundtrack to an accompanying Netflix film, which is essentially a 41-minute music video.Fitting, then, that the album opener is titled “Ronin,” meaning a wandering samurai with no master. The song kicks off with some grade-A foley work—boots crunching rocks on a dirt road, an old gas-guzzler wheezing to life, Alex Jones on the radio—and evolves into a swampy extended guitar solo that lays bare Simpson’s intentions for the rest of the album. Across 10 tracks, Simpson trades subtlety and plaintive guitar work for full-bore skronk and sleaze. It’s a hard but fearless turn away from what Simpson’s calling card of blurring the lines between country and psychedelia. On SOUND & FURY, Simpson throws both genres into the trunk of his car and does 85 down the backroads.Musically, SOUND & FURY has more in common with ZZ Top’s 1983 album Eliminator than Merle Haggard’s Hag—or any country album, really. The tracks are woven together by the car radio first heard on “Ronin,” as if Simpson is changing the station for us, showing that he can glide between synth-rock, glam, dancefloor-fillers; songwriting is king in his world. It doesn’t matter if he’s playing a dreamy campfire song—there are none here, by the way—or a two-minute instrumental stomper. Simpson is the one dictating his sound, take it or leave it.What works for Simpson is when he lets his soulful voice shine through, like on “All Said and Done,” the closest fans will get to a Simpson song of yore on the album, or “Mercury in Retrograde,” a bouncy pop tune with electric strings and a fluttering synth about fake friends who barge on to his tour bus to ask him if his songs are about them. This one is.What doesn’t quite land are tracks like “A Good Look,” co-written with John Prine, if you can believe it. It’s a frenetic disco-funk song, with a police-siren lead guitar and an overworked bassist. Its genuinely interesting and introspective lines about creating art, like, “I write my poems in the dirt with an oily rag/I have to wear a gas mask just so I don’t gag” become frustrating afterthoughts when followed by an incessant cowbell. There are a few more moments like this, where Simpson’s reliance on ’80s disco and funk often feels more like artifice than art, a reactionary and deliberate hard-right away from what has served him so well in the past: lush, beautiful soundscapes and sweeping choruses.The lyrics from “Make Art Not Friends,” anticipate such criticism. The song begins with an extended arpeggiated synth part that wouldn’t sound out of place on Tangerine Dream’s Tangram, before eventually evolving into a cohesive thesis for the album. “This town’s getting crowded, the truth’s been shrouded. I think it’s time to change up the sound,” Simpson croons. “The wheels keep turning, the flames get higher, another cycle rolls around.”Simpson has always looked for an escape. His first album, High Top Mountain, was his traditional country debut, a hail-mary attempt to make it; Metamodern Sounds in Country Music was his refutation of that style, with stoned panache; and he said he wrote A Sailor’s Guide to Earth because “people think I wake up in the morning and pour LSD on my Cheerios.” SOUND & FURY is miles down the road from any of his previous albums. As the album’s closer, “Fastest Horse in Town,” reaches the seven-minute mark and the radio sounds return, we hear that same car from “Ronin” revving up and speeding away. He’s likely already done with this sound, and on to the next one. Hell, he told his wife a few years ago that he’d make a bluegrass record someday composed of ’80s covers of her choosing. Only the real ones will be along for this ride, but, as he sings on “Mercury in Retrograde,” the album’s penultimate track, “the road to hell is paved with cruel intentions.” He’ll travel it solo if need be.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-01,7.2
Telefon Tel Aviv,Dreams Are Not Enough,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=electronic"">Electronic</a>","There was a time, not long ago, that Joshua Eustis doubted whether he would ever make another Telefon Tel Aviv record. Between 2001 and 2009, Eustis and his duo partner Charlie Cooper recorded three albums, establishing a singular fusion of maze-like circuitry and soulful melancholy that is part Autechre and part Depeche Mode. Then, the same week that their third album Immolate Yourself was released, Cooper disappeared and was found dead in his sleep. Shortly thereafter, Eustis’ father died, and then the film director John Hughes passed, whose son had put out Telefon Tel Aviv’s first album, and who Eustis said “was like a second father to me.” With a sizeable chunk of his world suddenly wiped out, Eustis faced the task of starting over.Gradually, he did just that. In 2014, Eustis released a solo album of elegant synth pop as Sons of Magdalene.. He produced for Tropic of Cancer and Vatican Shadow. He played in Tool frontman Maynard James Keenan’s group Puscifer and the brooding synth-pop trio the Black Queen; he was a touring member of Nine Inch Nails. And with Belong’s Turk Dietrich, he recorded two albums of deeply experimental dance music as Second Woman. Now, a decade after Immolate Yourself, Eustis returns with Dreams Are Not Enough, his first solo album under the alias.Telefon Tel Aviv were always downcast, but Dreams Are Not Enough sharpens and strengthens their most morose tendencies into a kind of probing and exquisite bleakness—what Eustis has described as “the rapture of despair.” The suffering is inseparable from the serotonin rush; it is storm-tossed sea and lifeboat all in one.The album is formally inventive in a way we don’t often expect of music so firmly grounded in gloomy electronic pop. In the course of the record’s trim 50 minutes, it winds between sandblasted ambient and misty-eyed synth pop, industrial techno and chamber choir; there are echoes of Chicago acid and Arvo Pärt alongside apocalyptic sound design reminiscent of Ben Frost. The scale of the thing is enormous, suggesting cliffs cleaving into the sea.Certain tropes recur throughout: Chief among these is a strange kind of zippering rhythm, speeding and slowing in cycles, like a stick being dragged along a metal grill. Second Woman made extensive use of the technique, but if there it could feel clinical, like an experiment in search of a real-world application, here it has a powerful emotional undertow. In the album’s opening track, it works like a bellows, stoking dull coals into full flame, and it’s put into similar service on nearly every song, wringing something wild and unpredictable out of what might otherwise have been merely politely forlorn. It often feels like the very stuff of the music is being torn apart.This recurring arrhythmic energy helps bind the album; so do the ambient interludes that stitch together contrasting tracks. The whole album works as a suite, a deep dive into a dream state. Eustis says he has experienced both lucid dreaming and sleep paralysis, and the album’s song titles are drawn from one of his nighttime visions. When read down the tracklist, they constitute a brief poem:I dream of it often:
a younger version of myself,
standing at the bottom of the ocean;
arms aloft,
mouth agape,
eyes glaring,
not seeing,
not breathing,
still as stone in a watery fane.Fittingly, for such an expression of Romantic yearning, Eustis’ songs dwell mostly upon loss, regret, and the passage of time, though his words are frequently indecipherable, buried beneath layers of distortion. It seems likely that’s on purpose: The lyrics are right there on the sleeve of the record, but they are mostly expressions of the kind of hurt that is as private as it is universal. Eustis dances between revealing and concealing, admission and denial, and that tension animates the record from within: emotional whiplash as the engine of life. In this, the album plays out very  much like the sweep of grief itself.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-10-01,8.1
Somos,Prison on a Hill,,"“From here on out we are Antifa-core,” Somos announced shortly after the release of Prison on a Hill. Their third album wears its radicalism on its sleeve: The title reappropriates the puritanical vision of their native Boston and Ronald Reagan’s sundowning American dream, while the cover utilizes anti-Nazi iconography. But more importantly, that’s what Phil Haggerty would’ve wanted. Somos’ guitarist passed away August 10 at age 28, and the band paid tribute by emphasizing his activism, posting local news footage of Haggerty ripping down white pride flyers.Their label, Tiny Engines, rush-released the album for a week to help defray funeral costs, donating the overage to the Heather Heyer Foundation. While Haggerty’s death lends an unfortunate urgency to Prison on a Hill, it doesn’t fundamentally change the album so much as emphasize what it already was: a band reaching a new level of confidence making songs about the human cost of late capitalism.Many punk bands rail against the “same 9-to-5, 16-to-65” from a position of moral superiority, whereas Somos’ breakout single “Dead Wrong” saw it as a trap that most don’t have the privilege to avoid. The average desk jockey wasn’t complacent or weak, just struggling to maintain sanity in a system that saps whatever energy could be spent trying to improve the collective lot. “We have insufficient hate for an unforgiving place,” Michael Fiorentino sang on 2016’s First Day Back, which prophetically alluded to a violent decline led by right-wing demagogues or apolitical shitposters (“You can mock anyone/You can find humor in anything”). Turns out it was both, and now Prison on a Hill surveys the suffering that results when these viewpoints gain even the slightest public legitimacy. “What do you think they’ll do to us, once they are really on the move?” Fiorentino asks on “Mediterranean,” a song inspired by the rise of anti-immigrant movements in Europe.While Somos’ political stance isn’t new, Prison on a Hill imagines it as a message worthy of thousands, rather than a few dozen in a basement. “Mediterranean” is a surefire, almost sweatless stadium-rock groove, the kind you hear from bands destined for beer commercials and an eventual gig opening for Foo Fighters. This is not the same band whose hiatus appeared permanent after their second album First Day Back, an album that managed to sound both demo-like and overproduced, alienating fans of their more rugged debut and failing to attract new ones. Throughout 2017, the group focused their energy on activism and other projects, but eventually returned to the recording studio with ideas to match their ambitions.Somos now operate with a newfound sense of adventure, doing everything more than in the past. The timid synth washes of First Day Back are swapped for pianos and strings on “Iron Heel” and “Mediterranean,” achieving a symphonic grandeur that might’ve once seemed overblown. “My Way to You” equally recalls the Tinkertoy beat-making of Tanlines and palm-muted pyrotechnics of early Taking Back Sunday, and delivers the album’s most unintentionally heartbreaking moment. “Thank you for the best years of your precious life” feels like foreshadowing now, even if “My Way to You” is still a quintessential Somos song, one where a faceless, domineering entity offers some kind of trinket—a medal, a retirement watch, a severance package—in exchange for human capital.Both dominant parties in American politics—the right and center-left—caricature Antifa as jackbooted extremists, rather than guys like Haggerty who fought racism on a street level and whose obituary noted how much he enjoyed the beach and the Boston Celtics. Prison on a Hill is also variously enraged, defeated, hopeful, and dreamless—but always empathetic, even for those who find themselves on the wrong side of history because they just didn’t see other options. The “heavily armed guards/Bored out of their minds/Desperately hoping for a chance to shoot to kill” on “Granite Face” and the shellshocked veteran on “Farewell to Exile” (“I was too young to see it all”) are treated in a way that targets the military-industrial complex, rather than the enlisted. Fiorentino has frequently utilized “the killing fields” as a metaphor in his lyrics, purposefully vague about whether he’s referring to a “war of annihilation” abroad or the simple fact that everyone is battling for an ever-dwindling amount of resources. “Iron Heel” takes its imagery from Mad Max, yet when Fiorentino sings “How did it feel to be born after the gold rush?” the post-apocalyptic wasteland might as well be the gig economy. Prison on a Hill is nearly 20 minutes longer than First Day Back, and its back half is subject to an occasional midtempo lull. But at its best, it’s like a Born in the U.S.A. for 2019: synth-gilded, blue-collar rock honoring people drafted into a war they had no part in creating.",2019-10-01,7.4
Thaiboy Digital,Legendary Member,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rap"">Rap</a>","Born in Thailand, raised in Sweden, and influenced by American rappers like Soulja Boy and 50 Cent, Thaiboy Digital (real name Thanapat Thaothawong) testifies to rap’s status as a global commodity. He also illustrates the gap separating the life of the music from its makers; Hip-hop might go where it wants, but human beings often have more trouble, and Thaiboy’s had a number of scuffles with Swedish immigration authorities over the years (he was deported back to Thailand for a spell in 2015).Those troubles don’t necessarily manifest in the lyrics of Legendary Member, Thaiboy’s debut album, but they have impacted how the album was made. His deportation to Thailand turned his creative collaboration with Drain Gang, a Swedish collective that includes producers Yung Sherman and Whitearmor and rappers Bladee and Ecco2K, into an entirely digital relationship, a wireless transmission pinging back and forth between different countries and disparate styles.A restless spirit, Thaiboy drifts between relentless and repetitive flows and Auto-Tuned falsetto crooning. There’s a sense of jubilant menace to straight-up rap cuts like “Drainstar Rock” and “Nervous,” which recount the expected tales of Bentley trucks and double cups. The simplicity of Thaiboy’s hooks — Volvo-sized couplets like “Break it in half/Kit Kat” and “Nowhere else to go/Kiss me through the scope” — betrays the complexity of his vocal delivery and the intricate production that buoys it. Thaiboy’s voice drones like a Gregorian men’s chorus when he’s rapping, but his most confident register is the melodic flow he flexes on glossy love songs like “Kiss Me Through the Scope” and “Lip Service.” The latter track, a duet with Drain Gang associate Ecco2K, is Thaiboy at his dreamiest, a lovestruck ode to an angelic raver girl. The production, handled exclusively by producers Gud, Whitearmor, Woesum, and Ripsquad, is equally dreamy: cascades of vocal samples on “Baby,” wind chimes on “Can’t Tell,” the glittering synth line that lends a melancholic chill to “Legendary Member.”It’s striking to consider how much-maligned American “mumble rap” has opened up space for rappers like Thaiboy and his seasonally affected compatriots in Stockholm, who come to English as a second, third, or fourth language. In an interview with The Fader, Thaiboy Digital describes his thought patterns as a trilingual speaker: “If I get surprised, I think in English. I like to curse in Swedish. And when it’s some real shit, I think in Thai.” Though his lyrics are almost exclusively in English, there are times where it sounds like Thaiboy is rapping in different languages in his mind. His vocal delivery overrides the specific meaning of individual words, making melodies from the sound of language itself.Mumble rap transforms what would have been considered mistakes or imperfections in another era of hip-hop into stylistic attributes; there’s meaning in how a voice sounds, not just in what it says. Precision and enunciation, the privileges of native speakers, aren’t priorities in hip-hop like they used to be, and it’s reshaped the linguistics of rap worldwide. The words that come out of Thaiboy Digital’s mouth are often slurred and unclear, their exact meaning obscured until you look up the lyrics, but the intended emotional effect is impossible to miss.",2019-10-01,7.2
John Coltrane,Blue World,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=jazz"">Jazz</a>","Sometimes a thing can be hidden without really hiding. Blue World, a previously unissued cache of studio recordings by the classic John Coltrane Quartet, comes to us in this vein: For the last 55 years, a clue to its existence could clearly be heard in the soundtrack to a well-regarded French-Canadian film, which interpolated portions of three separate tracks. But only in recent years have jazz scholars connected the dots, leading to what we have here: a 37-minute album (of sorts) by one of the most compelling bands in jazz history, at an unmistakable apex of cohesion.If this sounds vaguely familiar, it may be because of the afterglow of Both Directions at Once: The Lost Album, which Impulse! released, to critical acclaim and commercial triumph just last year. The precedent of that album, and what you could call its market validation, surely had something to do with the way that Coltrane’s estate and former label have rolled out this one. But it would be foolish to shrug off Blue World as yet more product off the archival assembly line. For any admirer of Coltrane, a saxophonist-composer-bandleader who embodied so much in the 1960s—deep mystery, spiritual fervor, hurtling momentum, searching humility—it’s a windfall worth greeting with fresh astonishment, before considering a handful of questions.So, in that spirit: Blue World offers a glimpse of the John Coltrane Quartet in a state of relaxed assurance, during the same span of time that would yield two landmarks, Crescent and A Love Supreme. Recorded at Van Gelder Studios on June 24, 1964, it’s a small assortment of songs from earlier in Coltrane’s career, refashioned by the evolving language of the band. And to a man—Coltrane on tenor saxophone, McCoy Tyner on piano, Jimmy Garrison on bass, Elvin Jones on drums—these musicians seem almost to luxuriate in the dark modal hum and polyrhythmic pull that had already become their trademark. They sound unburdened, as if they have no agenda to advance, and nothing to prove.Which stands in stark contrast to director Gilles Groulx, at whose behest this music was made. Trained as a documentary filmmaker, Groulx was working on his first feature, Le chat dans le sac (The Cat in the Bag)—a metaphorically charged portrait of a young couple’s unraveling, informed both by the French new wave and Québec’s emerging separatist movement—when he had the idea to approach Coltrane for a soundtrack. Coltrane agreed, but because the project fell outside the purview of his record contract, he left the date off the usual session logs. Groulx took the master tapes back to Montréal, where they were eventually stored in a vault of the National Film Board.Le chat dans le sac, an early touchstone for Québec cinema, uses only 10 minutes of Coltrane’s music—but in prominent places, with an obvious touch of pride. Barbara Ulrich, one of the film’s two stars (and Groulx’s romantic partner for a time), recalls in the Blue World liner notes that he had specific song requests for Coltrane. Drawn from albums in his personal collection, they represented objects in the saxophonist’s rearview. Coltrane wasn’t in the habit of revisiting previously recorded songs in the studio, but in this case, he and the band obliged.“Naima,” Coltrane’s tenderest ballad, first appeared on Giant Steps, the 1960 album that signaled his break from Miles Davis, and the beginning of a relationship with Atlantic Records. The song remained in Coltrane’s active repertory—you’ll find it, twice, on The Complete 1961 Village Vanguard Recordings—but its quietly smoldering treatment here is notable. Les chat opens with the full first take. (A second take is no less persuasive but a touch less vulnerable.)“Traneing In” is from an even earlier vintage: the album titled John Coltrane With the Red Garland Trio, recorded in 1957 and released, on Prestige, the following year. The version on Blue World begins with a nearly three-minute bass solo—a master class in low-end theory by Garrison, but not the sort of gesture that would have naturally suited an album track at the time. Coltrane must have embraced the idea that Groulx would pull choice excerpts from the session, taking it as a license to stretch. (The looseness in his own solo recalls a boxer’s warmup routine.)Groulx must have also admired the 1961 Atlantic album Coltrane Jazz, because Blue World includes two reimagined pieces from its tracklist, “Like Sonny” and “Village Blues.” The former, so named because Coltrane based its melody on a phrase he associated with Sonny Rollins, appears here in one brief and noncommittal take; Coltrane’s intonation and attack are shaky, and it would seem that he decided to set this tune aside. Honestly, it’s not a keeper.“Village Blues,” on the other hand, sounds marvelous in all three versions on Blue World. Take 2, which appears in the film, is the right selection. (The first take feels less focused rhythmically; the third maintains a lower simmer.) But these musicians could do no wrong playing the blues in this period, and the loping incantation of “Village Blues” is a near-perfect vehicle for them.Speaking of which, the title track of Blue World appears in two excerpts toward the end of Groulx’s film. This too is a callback: The song is a barely disguised rewrite of Harold Arlen and Johnny Mercer’s “Out of This World,” which had been the opening track of the 1962 album Coltrane. Its new title is almost certainly a ploy to evade copyright and licensing obligations, given that Coltrane employs such a similar arrangement as he did before. Still, the execution reflects a band with heavier traction, a stronger sense of itself. And there are moments in Coltrane’s solo when he cycles a motif through several tonal centers, testing an idea he’d soon push to center stage on A Love Supreme.The comparison that puts Blue World in clearer context, though, is Crescent, the title track of which had been recorded in the same room three weeks earlier. Ben Ratliff, one of Coltrane’s biographers, has observed: “Crescent does not contain the most impressive solos by any member of the John Coltrane Quartet; but in a span of six years with more cornerstone statements than most bands have listenable albums, it occupies the greatest part of that group’s center.”This is correct. And to extend the thought, Blue World falls just off-center—not a major addition to the Coltrane canon, but certainly an addition to a major part of it. There’s no serious argument to be made for its integrity as a proper album; there’s too much redundancy for that, and no way of knowing what Coltrane would have wanted. But the strongest moments on this offhanded, unintended artifact are remarkable even by the standards of this band at this juncture, and the historical record will reflect that. Finally, the cat’s out of the bag.",2019-09-30,8.4
rRoxymore,Face to Phase,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=electronic"">Electronic</a>","The most interesting dance music right now isn’t coming from house and techno; it’s happening in the margins, where producers are unafraid to fuck up a steady groove every now and then. Where mainstream house and techno (and their standard-issue “underground” variants) are concerned with getting everything just right—the right EQ on the drums, the right compression on the bass, the right number of bars leading up to the climax—the really interesting stuff right now takes its pleasure from getting the right things deliciously wrong.The UK label Don’t Be Afraid is helping lead this charge leftward. Even its clubbiest records are wobbly and moth-eaten, and with artists like Karen Gwyer, one of its most unpredictable talents, it has blazed new trails into the unknown. The debut album from the Berlin producer rRoxymore continues that trajectory: The French-born artist has spent the past decade crafting an increasingly idiosyncratic take on classic club styles, wrapping unvarnished drum machines in analog squelch and treating dance music’s most cherished rules with blithe disregard. Her early single “Wheel of Fortune” slows precipitously halfway through, threatening to derail any DJ who might be attempting to mix the record. On Face to Phase, she gives her experimental tendencies free rein.Face to Phase is still plenty forceful, and even danceable in places: “Passages,” which kicks the album into full gear following a dreamy ambient intro, wields its broken rhythm with serious strength, its burly kick drums landing like blows to the sternum; “Forward Flamingo,” which follows, boasts the kind of skulking, mysterious groove you could imagine hearing from a Lena Willikens set. Throughout, the music has all the hallmarks of sci-fi intrigue—shimmering Detroit pads, eerie chromatic progressions, Theremin-like tremolo squeals—with none of the self-consciously retro affect that’s customary in electronic music. The label says that most of the album was produced “in the box”—that is, primarily on the computer. So while it may sometimes sound analog, she’s clearly not much concerned with repeating old glories.Even at its most powerful, the music seems less interested in forward motion than in carving out space for exploration—the freedom to try out a knotty drum groove or an unusually iridescent palette—and then move on without looking back. By track four, “Energy Points,” which drizzles soft marimbas over irradiated background noise, dance music’s touchstones are beginning to dissolve. “Someone Else’s Memory” hints at the shakuhachi intro of Peter Gabriel’s “Sledgehammer” before launching into a stern, industrial march and then dropping the beat out just as abruptly, as though led by an absent-minded drum major. By the closing “What’s the Plan,” the slow-motion beats have succumbed to fatal enervation, stumbling and falling back into the glistening ooze.That might not sound like it’s supposed to be exciting, but it is; not many artists are this willing to short-circuit dancefloor function in the service of more idiosyncratic ends. It all adds up to an unusually expressive album, one that disregards clubland’s status quo in favor of far more imaginative terrain. The opening track, “Home Is Where the Music Is,” sets out to map that territory: a beatless synthesizer fantasia as tender and moving as a piano ballad, it sounds like old certainties being melted for scrap and turned into something new.",2019-09-30,7.7
Weeping Icon,Weeping Icon,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","In 1990, experimental filmmaker Jon Moritsugu released My Degeneration, a movie about an all-girl punk band called Fetish who get sponsored by Big Beef and spiral into chaos as a result of their success. Their songs become propaganda for juicy steaks and sausages, and their lead singer falls in love with a severed pig’s head named Livingston. It’s a hilarious parody of rock’n’roll excess, inflated egos, and the now-obsolete sin of “selling out.” The characters that populate Brooklyn punk band Weeping Icon’s self-titled debut are grappling with similar issues, only their patrons are lifestyle brands and their preferred platform is Instagram instead of a stage. On their sturdy first album, Weeping Icon offer a suite of detailed and coarse thrashers that pick apart our relationship with social media and #content in a way that is unpretentious and often quite funny.In 2017, Weeping Icon released Eyeball Under, an eight-track project stocked with energetic (if sometimes generic) punk cuts that were effective individually but didn’t stitch together as a whole. In contrast, Weeping Icon feels like a complete vision, aided by a studio team of Uniform’s Ben Greenberg and Eaters’ Jonathan Schenke, as well as the precise, discordant interludes that connect each song like barbed wire. These distorted tendrils mimic Weeping Icon’s live performances. “We don’t stop between songs because we want to sustain the energy and for the sets to be immersive,” the band said in a 2017 interview. “We want people to feel very present.” Considering that most of the lyrics on Weeping Icon skewer the amount of time we spend staring into our phones, you might say the desire to be present is one of the album’s unspoken themes.The instrumental vignettes do command presence. They cast an apocalyptic pall over the record, perpetuating a feeling of unease, but they also allow the full-length tracks to pop. “Be Anti” punches through the sickly, arrhythmic heartbeat of “(you should listen to me),” delivering a snarky sendup of counterculture fit for Portlandia. Singer and guitarist Sara Fantry spews a vague monologue about how fucked up the world is. She’s pissed off, and there is only one way to change things: “I’m gonna spit,” she snarls, before making sure the act was captured on video. “Did you get it?” She asks. “Post it on Instagram… Do you have Snapchat? Oh, Facebook Live, put it on Facebook Live. I’ll do it again.” It’s an abridged version of something we see every day: People staging their lives for an invisible audience.Throughout, Weeping Icon poke fun at the discrepancies between the lives we live and those we post online. On “Like Envy,” Fantry takes on the persona of an Instagram influencer. “I post every day at 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.,” she gushes. “My life is my brand.” By the song’s end, Weeping Icon’s instruments have been kicked into overdrive, Fantry’s buzzsaw guitar shooting off sparks while Sarah Lutkenhaus’ synthesizer howls like a wild dog. Fantry’s character, meanwhile, has completely unraveled. She sounds like she’s crouched over a pile of burning rubble, compulsively listing Instagram filters she can no longer use, because the world has ended.It would be too easy for Weeping Icon’s critique of the social-media generation to come off as heavy-handed and out of touch—fortunately, they’re just as guilty as the rest of us. “We’ve all taken selfies,” Fantry said in a recent interview. “We’re on social media all the time.” Their participation in the phenomenon and their sense of humor (one of the songs is literally the bandmates laughing uncontrollably) are what save Weeping Icon from sounding like an album made by Abe Simpson, or worse, your dad.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-09-30,7.7
Sarah Hennies,Reservoir 1: Preservation,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=experimental"">Experimental</a>","Much the way Paul Klee compared drawing a line to taking a walk, American composer Sarah Hennies’ Reservoir 1: Preservation feels like what happens when a percussion ensemble throws on its hiking boots. The 56-minute work, the first of three Reservoir pieces based on the relationship between the conscious and unconscious mind, is scored for three percussionists, who shake, hit, and tease their instruments into vividly atmospheric shapes over a piano’s sparse, mournful melody.The piano is ever present in Reservoir 1, its jazzy, sometimes jarring lines played with admirable restraint by Phillip Bush. But it is the percussion, performed by Hennies alongside her partners in the improvisational group Meridian, Tim Feeney and Greg Stuart, that stars. We are used to percussion playing a supporting role to the whims of melody, or serving as a tool for dancing. Here, though, it dominates, driving Reservoir 1's heady atmosphere as if indifferent to the demands of the piano's chords. This is percussion as a tool for expression, an end in itself rather than a means toward a wider goal.The dramatic range achieved by such apparently limited means is impressive. Toward the start of the piece, shakers cut through the piano’s artfully dripped melody to inject urgency and life, their rhythms overlapping in a way that suggests the babble of hurried conversation. Later, percussive touches bring tension, echoing the nervous patter of rain on a tin roof as it builds to a storm. From there, Reservoir 1 dives into emotional extremes. At 26 minutes, a globular droning effect conveys drowsy serenity; five minutes later this has curdled into paranoia and violence, as blunt percussive blows strike malignantly, recalling percussionist Alasdair Malloy’s meticulous assault on a slab of meat for Scott Walker’s The Drift. Through all this, the piano drifts onward, discernible but somehow out of reach, the mysterious unconscious to the juddering passion of percussion’s conscious mind.The constancy of the piano helps to hold Reservoir 1 together; its internal logic bonds the album into a coherent, satisfying listen. But Reservoir 1 is adaptable, too. Hennies has said that the idea behind the three Reservoir pieces—the second was premiered in spring 2019 by flautist Claire Chase and vocal performance ensemble Constellation Chor, while the third is intended to be a piece for strings—is that they will work together and individually. It’s also possible to cherry-pick outstanding moments from Reservoir 1’s well-rounded whole. I love the stumbling rhythm between bass drum and woodblocks around the 10-minute mark, which seems to delight in slipping out of frame, and the haunting scrabble at 44 minutes that echoes the ghostly cracking of an abandoned boat at sea.The occasional frustration with Reservoir 1 is that it can feel like it would be better experienced live than on record. Meridian drift so far from typical percussive sounds over the 56-minute piece that human nature demands to know how this music is being made. But what the listener loses in understanding, they gain in mystery. Hennies has spoken of the importance of recordings in removing the visual associations that we have around music, with the sight of a cymbal being played, for example, automatically triggering certain assumptions. On Reservoir 1 the shape-shifting percussive palette is all the more gripping for its enigmatic origins, like a magic trick that must forever remain secret. Hennies’ work is an oasis of inscrutability, where ignorance is bliss and time slips by unhurried.",2019-09-30,7.8
ABBA,Gold: Greatest Hits,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=pop"">Pop/R&amp;B</a>","What, exactly, is the use of a “greatest hits” album in 2019? The full catalogs of almost every artist popular enough to merit such a collection are available through any streaming service, organized by algorithms, and easily sorted by play count, which means labels have little reason to waste time and energy on a task the machines have already mastered. Even when the indie rock band Spoon released a greatest hits record earlier this year, the band acknowledged that its fondness for the form outweighed what was a near-certain losing proposition businesswise.That fondness exists because of the real power greatest hits albums once had: They threw open doors for curious new listeners, solidified artists’ place in the canon, and transformed reputations that had fallen into disrepair. In his 2016 eulogy for greatest hits, anthologies, and other, similar reissues, Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted that Bob Marley could have languished in relative obscurity were it not for the release of Legend in 1984. “By focusing on the hits, they crystallize the essence of each star,” wrote Erlewine, touching on compilations of work by Elton John, Billy Joel, and Tom Petty. “Over time, those greatest hits albums—purchased as a package, repeated incessantly on the radio—formalized each act’s conventionally-accepted canon and, in turn, cemented their enduring public personas.”If the ideal greatest hits collection captures the fundamental truth about an artist, stitches them into an enduring place in our cultural fabric, and sells enough copies to fund the purchase of a minor island, then ABBA Gold—a 79-minute buffet of schlocky ballads, elegant pop delicacies, and disco heat rocks—is the definitive example of the format. The 1992 compilation rounded up all of the Swedish pop band’s international smashes into a refined package with surprising emotional range. It capitalized on a simmering, subcultural interest in ABBA’s work and sparked a full-blown revival, one that culminated in Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan belting and grunting their way through “S.O.S.” in the movie version of Mamma Mia! And it became one of the best-selling albums of all time, with copies continuing to trickle out of stores in shocking numbers to this day. Because of Gold, ABBA has become an integral part of the world around us, their music floating through common spaces around the world like a music fan’s lingua franca; without it, the band might have remained a curio, the kind of half-forgotten treasure you have to seek out rather than stumble upon.Little more than a decade separated Gold’s release from the unceremonious end of the band’s recording career. After a delirious rise to global superstardom in the second half of the ’70s, ABBA was finally starting to lose steam. Its two constituent couples—Björn Ulvaeus and Agnetha Faltskog, and Benny Andersson and Frida Lyngstad—were either separated or divorced by the release of their final album, The Visitors, in 1981. And while all four members continued working together with an impressive level of professionalism, the fact remained that Ulvaeus and Andersson were writing music and lyrics, including post-breakup ballads and wounded domestic dramas, for their ex-wives to sing.The band had soured on touring and promoting themselves after enduring some of the most frenzied appearances this side of Beatlemania, and the fatigue was showing up in their music: “I was sick and tired of everything/When I called you last night from Glasgow,” sighed Lyngstad on the title track of 1980’s Super Trouper. “All I do is eat and sleep and sing/Wishing every show was the last show.” And after conquering the pop charts in dozens of countries around the world, everyone was ready for a new challenge: Andersson and Ulvaeus were dreaming of a detour into musical theater, and Faltskog and Lyngstad were curious about reviving their dormant solo careers.Boredom aside, ABBA’s commercial peak was clearly in the rear-view mirror by the early ’80s. The Visitors was their least successful album since the beginning of their career, and the band’s generation-spanning core audience was starting to wander into new spaces. The children who grew up with ABBA omnipresent on the radio were maturing into punk, rap, and new wave; the adults who enjoyed their lighthearted, melodic hits were less interested in minimally arranged character studies. Studio sessions in the spring of 1982 yielded little more than a few singles, and by the end of that year, it was clear ABBA’s time had come. Andersson and Ulvaeus collaborated with Tim Rice on Chess, a musical about a chess tournament (and love triangle) set against the backdrop of the Cold War; Lyngstad made an album with Phil Collins; Faltskog scored a few solo hits and duets before largely retreating from public life.From a distance, it must have seemed unlikely that ABBA would explode back into the popular consciousness and stay there indefinitely. Yet Gold was perfectly positioned to take advantage of shifts in technology, music business, and the culture at large, all of which crested alongside the compilation’s release in 1992. In the decade since ABBA’s collapse, CDs had become the dominant form of physical media and were accelerating toward their turn-of-the-century peak. While the CD market had been steadily growing since the end of the ’80s, reissues covering the ABBA catalogue had become conspicuously absent from record store shelves around the world, a consequence of business decisions made near the beginning of the band’s career—all handled by the group’s famously unscrupulous manager, Stig Anderson—and an ensuing string of contracts, renegotiations, and acquisitions.“Many in the music business raised their eyebrows when Stig signed with different record companies all over the world, instead of letting one major label handle the group globally,” wrote Carl Magnus Palm in his essential ABBA biography Bright Lights, Dark Shadows: The Real Story of ABBA. “That, however, was the whole point. Stig’s theory was that no company could be strong in every territory around the world and ABBA’s interests would be better served by working with the label that had the most impressive sales presence in each market.” Anderson’s decision to establish a network of international distributors meant that by the band’s demise, ABBA’s catalog could be handled differently according to each country’s needs; the compilation slapped onto shelves in Madrid wouldn’t necessarily be the same as the one stocked in Melbourne.When Anderson’s Polar Music Group (and, consequently, ABBA’s songs and masters) were acquired by Polygram (now part of Universal Music Group) in 1989, the label had to wait for Polar’s patchwork of licensing deals to expire before devising a coherent strategy with which to approach ABBA’s library of hits. Plans for a box set were pared back to a single disc, a conservative play intended to gauge the market for the band’s catalog before investing any more resources. The label polled its offices around the world regarding song selection, market tested the album’s cover art—its classy, minimal black-on-gold a far from the kitsch of ABBA’s studio album artwork—with potential British buyers, and made sequencing decisions based on fan feedback rather than chronology.Even though Polygram was dedicating reasonable amounts of time and money to ABBA’s revitalization, they still underestimated the amount of latent interest in the band’s music by the early ’90s, in part because that enthusiasm was rooted in marginalized communities. For gay men around the world, ABBA’s blend of naïve camp—consider the outfits they wore on stage, which ran the gamut from High Elven couture to sets of matching white silk kimonos—indelible melodies, and genuinely wrenching melodrama proved captivating. They wrote anthems for dancing queens and men after midnight, inadvertently adopting language that would become essential to gay life. And as much as the gay community loved ABBA, the band returned the favor: “In the ’80s, especially the first half, [it] was like ABBA was forgotten,” said Ulvaeus in a 2019 interview with Gay Times. “We thought that was it, we go on and do other stuff and ABBA will be forgotten. Then it was the gay community who underpinned the comeback… we felt that we had the full support, and it made a lot of difference.”Goofy cover bands like Australian outfit Björn Again built on this enthusiasm for ABBA’s music and became genuine sensations at clubs around the world, dialing up the kitsch with even more outlandish attire and between-song banter delivered in Swedish accents. And if the commercial potential of ABBA’s music wasn’t already evident, it became impossible to ignore in mid-1992 when Erasure’s cover EP Abba-esque topped the charts across the UK and continental Europe.So came the perfect storm surrounding Gold’s release: assembled at an ascendant moment in the music business by a label that approached the ABBA catalog with an unprecedented level of coordination and thoughtfulness, delivered to a public desperate for a convenient way to hear the band’s hits. It’s a fascinating story, yet it still doesn’t explain why millions of people around the world were ready to embrace ABBA once more with feeling. What is it about this band’s music that spoke, and continues to speak, to listeners across languages, cultures, and borders?Unlike the great majority of contemporary hits, ABBA’s version of pop music is completely divorced from the influence of R&B, hip-hop, soul, funk, and Latin music—in short, from non-white musical traditions. Ulvaeus summed up their approach rather neatly in a 1981 interview: “Our musical roots are European—we like French and Italian songs,” said Ulvaeus. “This is probably why our songs work well in the countries of Latin America… in the United States, pop music is heavily influenced by the blues, soul, and gospel—which isn’t in ABBA’s heritage.”Ulvaeus and Andersson grew up on traditional Swedish folk music and schlager music, a sappy, simple strain of pop with a distinctly continental European flair. And when their tastes began to develop as teenagers, they developed a network of influences that remained almost exclusively white: the Beach Boys’ golden teenage hymns, Phil Spector’s Wall of Sound, Lennon and McCartney circa Rubber Soul, classical music, and musical theater. It’s no surprise that as mature composers and lyricists, they came to favor crystalline melodies, dizzying arrangements and counterpoints, and over-the-top emotional gestures.This mix of influences helped create the band’s reputation as purveyors of unrefined schmaltz. The songs on Gold that have aged most poorly are the cuts that bear the greatest schlager influences, songs like “Chiquitita” and “Fernando” and “I Have a Dream.” Even gorgeous hooks wilt up against inelegant English lyrics, martial Germanic pomp, and faux-Italian balladry.Rare misses aside, hearing Faltskog and Lyngstad’s impeccable voices weave through a battalion’s worth of riffs, bells, and whistles is an indefatigable source of ecstasy. Listening to “S.O.S.” or “Dancing Queen” or “Super Trouper” for the first time can feel like hearing “Good Vibrations” or “Born to Run” in the same fashion: Your pleasure centers are overwhelmed until they blow up like the Grinch’s tiny heart, expanding beyond their old size and becoming something new.Listening to Gold with fresh, focused ears, I was struck by the sheer variety of sounds beneath its blinding polish. The ABBA ground-zero that’s anchored in my head lies somewhere between “Lay All Your Love on Me” and “The Winner Takes It All”: cavernous, sprightly, desperate dance-pop confections built for crying in the club. (Robyn became one of this decade’s great pop heroes by pinning down this same sad-ecstatic balance and welding it to modern, muscular production.) And while this might have become their most distinctive mode, it was far from their only one.“Take a Chance on Me” is best remembered for its a cappella opening buoyant chorus, but its verses are pure Swedish honky-tonk; I hear them and think of Daft Punk’s “Fragments of Time,” a hidden jam on Random Access Memories that’s built on a warm country boogie. (Speaking of Random Access Memories: while that album’s connection to Giorgio Moroder may have been more explicit, its primary sound—expensive, theatrical, continental European pop—is pure ABBA.) “Money, Money, Money” is the most successful of Ulvaeus and Andersson’s early forays into musical theater, a gold-digging fantasy that’s given real edge through Lyngstad’s dramatic interpretation. Late-period hit “One of Us” is heartbroken, lilting reggae, and it boasts one of Faltskog’s most delicate vocal takes for good measure; glammy stomper “Does Your Mother Know” is dumb, clean fun, even if hearing Ulvaeus take the lead makes you wish they’d called in Elton John for the supremely bitchy guest spot the song deserves. The magnificent “Knowing Me, Knowing You” finds the band at its best and its silliest in the span of 60 seconds: An elegant chorus with a male countermelody leads into a second verse spoiled by vaguely, unintentionally pornographic backing whispers.Skeptics pointed to the watch-like precision of every new ABBA hit as evidence of the band’s soullessness. In a 1993 essay in TIME after Gold’s American release, critic Richard Lacayo wrote that the band “was always easy to enjoy, if you could just put aside the unnerving sense that they were hastening the decline of pop music into commercial calculation and mindless buoyancy.” But the level of quality represented on Gold sprung from more than just studio scheming or bald ambition. By the time ABBA won the 1974 Eurovision contest with “Waterloo,” Andersson and Ulvaeus had each enjoyed a decade of domestic success as musicians, and Faltskog and Lyngstad were working solo artists in their own right. They had collectively played thousands of tour dates across Sweden, produced music for dozens of other artists, and spent untold hours working as a songwriting and performing team. Their mastery and enthusiasm for their craft was indisputable.Calling ABBA icy or passionless also conveniently elides the intricate balance between their craftsmanship and mournful writing. Take it from no less an authority than Max Martin: “I’m a sucker for the melancholy,” admitted the legendary pop producer in a 2001 interview with TIME Europe. “I guess that’s one of the things, coming from [Sweden]. If you listen to ABBA… it’s always sort of melancholy.” Ulvaeus and Andersson had figured out the balance as early as “S.O.S.,” ABBA’s first major international hit after “Waterloo.” It sounds like Faltskog is singing the first verse from the bottom of a well; her loneliness and desperation are so thick, you can almost reach out and touch them. When the chorus finally arrives, its warmth is palpable until, all of a sudden, it’s not: “When you’re gone,” Faltskog chirps, “How can I even try to go on?” The contrast is stark, and it’s irresistible.As the division of labor between Andersson and Ulvaeus became clearer later in the band’s discography—the former handled most of the music, the latter wrote the bulk of the lyrics—the divide between subject matter and sound became even more pronounced. The tumult of the band’s personal lives began to subtly leak into their art: “Knowing Me, Knowing You” and “The Winner Takes It All” are crushing glimpses at marriages in disrepair, sung by adults who know they can’t help but carry on with their lives. Relatively silly cuts like future booty-call anthem “Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)” are marked by quiet urgency: “Half-past 12/And I’m watchin’ the late show in my flat all alone/How I hate to spend the evening on my own,” Faltskog moans. Even “Dancing Queen,” the band’s most purely joyous moment, can’t fully give itself over to pleasure. It’s a celebration of impermanence. You may be young and sweet now, but you won’t be 17 forever.Erlewine wrote that greatest hits have a way of “sand[ing] away the artists’ quirks,” and the same is true for Gold. Polygram’s decision to detach the album’s sequencing from the arc of ABBA’s career makes it harder to appreciate the band’s gradual transformation. The silly, glammy Swedes who galloped onto the stage at Eurovision took over the world, stormed the disco, and finished their career making their saddest, strangest music yet. (The new ABBA music reportedly recorded as part of a 2018 reunion has yet to materialize). And yet Gold still conveys the one thing you absolutely need to know about the band: For about a decade, these four Swedes cracked the code on pop music.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-09-29,8.3

He dreamed of writing songs that the whole world could sing along to—but he wanted to do it his own way.Four new vinyl reissues offer a thrilling survey of his journey as a pop songwriter. The series comprises the band’s 1984 debut Swoon, 1988’s commercial peak From Langley Park to Memphis, 1990’s double album Jordan: The Comeback, and 1992’s The Best of Prefab Sprout: A Life of Surprises. These reissues—which feature subtly improved artwork and sharp remasters from McAloon and his brother Martin—leave out but orbit around Steve McQueen, their 1985 masterpiece that remains the ideal entry point to their catalog. It was a breakthrough for the band members, marking their first collaboration with producer Thomas Dolby, whose playful, surreal touch helped define their characteristic sound. Dolby even helped curate that album’s tracklist, choosing songs from a stockpile that McAloon had amassed since forming the band with Martin in County Durham, England in the late ’70s.Several of those songs predated Swoon, their scrappy debut, whose post-punk edge would be abandoned for a smoother, more sophisticated sound. While Swoon was unrepresentative of the band that Prefab Sprout would become, it set the template for how they’d navigate the pop world. The brothers were joined by multi-instrumentalist and vocalist Wendy Smith, who accompanied McAloon for wordless refrains and non-sequitur exclamations that took pleasure in twisting expectations. McAloon was beginning to write eloquently about heartbreak and adulthood (“Cruel,” “Elegance”) but he was also having a blast addressing questions that most songwriters might find trivial: What is the life of a celebrity chessmaster? When was the last time you played basketball?After Swoon and the critical acclaim that followed Steve McQueen, the band recorded and shelved a quieter follow-up (Protest Songs, eventually released in 1989) before setting off to make something that capitalized on their newfound momentum. At the time of its release, the cinematic From Langley Park to Memphis was largely overshadowed by its first two tracks: the semi-novelty hit “The King of Rock and Roll” (which arrived with a fittingly absurd music video) and the Springsteen-referencing “Cars and Girls.” As a one-two punch, they rightfully stand among Prefab Sprout’s most recognizable songs, and the rest of the record is just as catchy and complex.McAloon was now penning his own version of standards (“Nightingales”), reverb-coated alt-rock anthems (“The Golden Calf”), and dramatic singalongs that could find a second life on Broadway (“Hey Manhattan”). His writing favored narrators in sad, autumnal stages: “All my lazy teenage boasts are now high precision ghosts/And they’re coming ‘round the tracks to haunt me,” go the opening lyrics to “The King of Rock and Roll,” imagining the life of an older touring musician, every night singing the same meaningless words that he wrote decades ago. And yet the music sounds colorful and hopeful and alive—everything seems to sparkle, right down to the glossy band photo on the album cover.With that photo, lovingly filtered here to look slightly more artful, the band signaled that they were pivoting away from their underground beginnings. Released at a time when American indie bands like R.E.M. and the Replacements were beginning to make bids for larger audiences, McAloon was making a similar leap, even if he still preferred staying out of the spotlight. While his songs were newly poised for radio and MTV, he remained wary of fame, setting on a reclusive path that would span the rest of his career. “This isn’t meant to sound snobbish,” he told Melody Maker at the time, “but I’ve never felt a part of any community… I don’t go out and look for like-minded people and I’ve never found anyone on the planet who fits the bill.” From Langley Park remains the band’s closest brush to stardom, but McAloon kept finding new ways to push himself.On Jordan: The Comeback, the most ambitious Prefab Sprout album and one of their greatest, McAloon created his own mythological world to blend into. The cast of characters are drawn from the Bible (including star turns from Michael the Archangel, Satan, and God himself) as well as rock history. A suite of songs in the middle of the album imagines Elvis Presley, having faked his death and retreated to the desert, dreaming of the perfect comeback song to launch his next act. McAloon, meanwhile, was also searching for the follow-up for his own biggest hits. “Wild Horses” is a romantic fantasy whose sleek arrangement still sounds fresh, while “The Ice Maiden” offers one of the most memorable lyrics in his songbook: “Death is a small price for heaven.” It was a comeback album obsessed with comebacks, from rebound relationships to resurrections. Less commercially successful than Langley but just as rewarding, it’s a work so layered that, decades on, it still seems to hold new secrets.When it came time to compile Prefab Sprout’s career highs into an album-length primer, A Life of Surprises didn’t quite capture the full picture. The picks from Jordan are less meaningful stripped of the album’s purposeful sequencing, while the one selection from Swoon sounds jarringly out of place in the non-chronological tracklist. Not to mention, “Bonny,” a stunner from Steve McQueen, is nowhere to be found. What the set does provide, however, are two essential non-album cuts that lend fitting closure to this era of the band’s career. The glittery, pulsing single “If You Don’t Love Me” would later be reimagined as a piano ballad by Kylie Minogue, bringing McAloon’s unlikely pop dreams to reality. But it’s “The Sound of Crying” that really shows how far he had come, pairing one of his most gorgeous melodies to a strange, brilliant vision of the world in flux. “Sometimes I think that God is working to a plan,” he sings, his voice breathier and softer with age. “And other times I’m sure that he is improvising.” Lamenting a chaotic universe, he casts a higher power in his own image: obsessive and inscrutable, observing us from somewhere that he can’t be reached, and searching for a tune.Buy: Rough Trade (Swoon) (From Langley Park to Memphis) (Jordan: The Comeback) (A Life of Surprises: The Best of Prefab Sprout)(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-09-28,8.2
Blink-182,NINE,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","Pop-punk’s appeal has always been the fusing of the hook-filled sentiments of pop music with the direct current of punk. They are two prongs that any band, particularly those that find something close to mainstream success, are forced to straddle. This dilemma—how to, in the misquoted words of Donnie and Marie Osmond, be a little bit pop while also being a little bit punk—is one that blink-182 has been struggling with for years now.The apex of their fame revealed serious fissures in the group’s long-term stability, leading singer and guitarist Tom DeLonge to leave the group after their 2003 self-titled album, start the new band Angels & Airwaves, and get really into U.F.O. conspiracies. He’d rejoin for 2011’s Neighborhoods, but since 2015, DeLonge’s place in the band has been taken by Alkaline Trio singer Matt Skiba. Blink picked up their first Grammy nod with 2016’s California, and the band now seems singularly focused on making sure the brand endures into the future, which never really seemed like much of a priority during their most erratic years.With NINE, their eighth album, blink is in search of a more sustainable kind of success. They’re aiming at a more youthful audience, maybe the kinds of kids who inadvertently came to pop-punk by way of Lil Peep, but blink-182 have long held appeal to people who didn’t cut their teeth in the punk scene. Take drummer Travis Barker, who is all over the last decade of hip-hop, from Run the Jewels to Lil Wayne to Young Dro. He tends to work with artists who aren’t exactly in vogue, usually aggressive, Generation-X rappers, like LL Cool J, Cypress Hill, and Xzibit, or the younger and critically unacclaimed, like Machine Gun Kelly and Yelawolf. But Barker has benefited tremendously from hip-hop’s du jour reverence for pop-punk, emo, and alternative rock, repositioning himself into something of a Rick Rubin-esque Svengali of a younger generation of SoundCloud rap. Over the past year, he’s shown up on songs by Lil Nas X, XXXTentacion, and Ghostemane and executive produced EPs by $uicideboy$ and 03 Greedo.It’s Barker’s drum programming that shapes the sound of NINE more than anything else. His beats have always sounded a little bit like Pharrell’s, with that booming bass sound you can hear being so clearly played by a human hand on a drum machine. There are shades of Barker’s hip-hop work all over NINE, particularly on a song like “Hungover You,” which opens with an uptempo, danceable drumline and ends with a pattern of bass tones begging to be blasted out of oversized trunk speakers.This is a clear bid for the kind of success currently enjoyed by bands like Fall Out Boy and Panic! at the Disco. Blink-182 worked on NINE alongside pop songwriting teams like Captain Cuts and the Futuristics, as well as Ali Tamposi, the co-writer of Kelly Clarkson’s “Stronger.” It’s impossible to hear a song like “I Really Wish I Hated You” and not sense the Chainsmokers lurking in the corner. “On Some Emo Shit” pulls from the same well of lazy Big Apple tropes (“I thought I saw you at the Bodega,” “Thinking back to times in Manhattan and that SoHo Gallery”) as Taylor Swift’s “Welcome to New York.” It’s a song that sounds written to accompany B-roll of the fictitious Brooklyn of TV Land’s Younger, a show about a middle-aged woman masquerading as a millennial—an experience that’s probably relatable to the members of blink-182.Even if their sound is somewhat refurbished and compressed, blink-182 still avoid guest features and a full pivot from pop-punk to pure pop. Their flirtations with light EDM and hip-hop backbeats aren’t exactly new—“Run Away” sounds a lot like Linkin Park at their peak, with stuttering drums and manipulated vocals scattered across the rest of the album. There’s still plenty of speedy guitar playing and a lot of mournful rage. Mark Hoppus’ lyrics largely stem from his recent personal experiences with depression, but with the new sound, there’s also a new commitment to offering advice and inspiration to younger fans, like on the song “Happy Days,” where the band addresses a kid whose head is filled with “dread and doubt.”It’s surprising how well the new sound works, though the voice of Skiba doesn’t always mesh comfortably with the production. As always, angst and unrequited affections are aplenty, but it all feels far too tame. Skiba and Hoppus wail to high heaven on “No Heart To Speak Of,” nothing approaches the bleeding feelings of “Josie” or the paranoia that permeates 1999’s Enema of the State.Blink-182’s late-career work has largely been overshadowed by Tom DeLonge’s sincere effort to prove that aliens really do exist, in its own way a less surprising late-career pivot than a developmentally arrested band courting of a younger crowd. DeLonge has moved on, but he’s stayed weird in a way the rest of blink hasn’t. The band fits neatly into their shiny new suit, but they look better naked.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-09-28,5.2
Jack Harlow,Confetti,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rap"">Rap</a>","Jack Harlow is from Louisville, Kentucky, but without the defiant “I’m a Kentucky boy til’ death” shoutout on 2018 breakout “Sundown,” you wouldn’t know it. His fourth full-length project in just as many years, Confetti sounds like it could be made by any 21-year-old that grew up with access to Hot 97: He reflects on driving around his city listening to The Blueprint on CD and raps over samples of Usher’s “U Don’t Have to Call” and Trey Songz’s “I Invented Sex.” His music has no identity. But he has a natural charm and energy that helps you overlook the fact that you’ve heard countless albums like this before, just by different names.Prior to Confetti, Jack Harlow’s big singles were 2017’s “Dark Knight” and the aforementioned “Sundown.” The self-confident bounce of the former earned him his current record deal with DJ Drama and Don Cannon’s Lil Uzi Vert-cursed Generation Now label. The more polished “Sundown” boasts a Neptunes-influenced beat from his frequent collaborator 2forwOyNE that complements his low-key swagger.  Both songs balance a light, teen-movie party atmosphere with warm reflections on his hometown.This is Jack Harlow’s sweet spot, and when he remains there, he cranks out enjoyable DJ-set filler. Album intro “Ghost” is upbeat enough to ignore Harlow’s painful one-liners (“I got all the whipper-snappers and the lil’ rascals”) while serving as a reminder that DJ Drama’s “Gangsta Grillz” tag is timeless. On later tracks like “Heavy Hitter,” Harlow’s natural charisma elevates typical first-record-deal topics like dating women who use him to build their LinkedIn connections. The light-spirited “Walk in the Park” would’ve made sense on the back half of an Aminé or KYLE project.But like so many emerging rappers, Jack Harlow seems to think that for his music to take the next step, he has to sing. On the Da Honorable C.N.O.T.E-produced “Sunday Night,” his fun-loving personality is lost in the minute he opens his mouth: “I know that a ‘you up’ text would be fucked up, but I’d be lying if I told you I ain’t wanna,” he sings weakly. He talks about relationships so impersonally that he might just be reciting the plot of the last television series he binged. His vocals suck the life out of his coming-of-age reflections on “Goin Back Down,” and his Louisville tales only come to life when he connects with his hometown hero Bryson Tiller for the sappy duet “Thru the Night.”Jack Harlow’s music is harmless. If you come across any of Confetti’s standouts on a Spotify playlist, you won’t be moved to complain or click over to his artist page. At his best, he can make above-average slappers like “Heavy Hitter” and “Ghost,” and that’s enough to keep him afloat. Well, that’s until the next Jack Harlow comes around, with a new name, representing another underappreciated city, and then we can have this conversation all over again.",2019-09-28,5.6
Tegan and Sara,"Hey, I’m Just Like You","<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","In 1998, Tegan and Sara caused a small stir when they won a Calgary, Alberta talent contest called Garage Warz. The identical twins appeared on a local news segment to talk excitedly about their win, draped in capacious clothing and distinguishable by Sara’s long hair and Tegan’s lip piercing. “The thing that I like the best,” said Sara, “is that, I don’t think that [the judges] think, ‘Wow, they’re perfect, they [need] no improvement’... I think they just see maybe a sparkle of something, that can get to be something bigger.”Even in her wide-eyed hopefulness, Sara probably didn’t imagine that the duo would go on to have a storied 20-year career: first as Canadian grunge-folk darlings, then pop-punk rebels embraced by the White Stripes and Paramore, and later as synth-pop troubadours joining Taylor Swift onstage. On Tegan and Sara’s ninth studio album, Hey, I'm Just Like You—and the simultaneously released High School, a co-written memoir about their time dropping acid and moshing to Green Day in the ’90s—they revisit their roots, re-recording demos they wrote as teenagers. This time, they’re both the open-hearted teenage songwriters and the wiser industry professionals who can spot, and expand on, their spark.It’s a smart move for a band whose fan base has both aged with them, and continually refreshed itself with younger members. At a Tegan and Sara show, you’re as likely to meet women in their 30s or 40s who have been die-hard fans of the trailblazing LGBTQ icons since the opening guitar strums of “You Wouldn’t Like Me” in 2004 as you are to meet younger listeners who caught the wave with their 2016 breakthrough pop hit “Boyfriend.” On Hey, I’m Just Like You, the band seem to acknowledge and speak to each of these audiences at once. Listening to the title track in its plaintive, unvarnished demo form, it’s clear that it was written by the same two girls who, as described in their memoir, once built a shrine to Kurt Cobain. On the album, the song opens with sharp claps, and builds to a synth-spangled chorus that cushions the jagged melancholy of the original in a pop cocoon.As well as reconciling their different sounds, the album is a fierce reminder of the twins’ ability to write an irresistible chorus. Particularly memorable ones here include the stadium-sized exhalation of “I Don’t Owe You Anything,” the bratty moshpit-lite chorus of “Hold My Breath Until I Die,” and the angst-ridden, fist-pumping “I Know I’m Not the Only One.”  On “Don’t Believe the Things They Tell You (They Lie),” a clunky title becomes a surprisingly great refrain when the song breaks open, halfway through, into a widescreen anthemic surge.“Don’t Believe…” is not the album’s only clunky phrasing. Glancing through the track list is like flicking through a teen’s journal, with its powerful “get off my case, Mom” energy. The album’s general embrace of Tegan and Sara’s teenage earnestness is mostly its strength, but there are moments that grate: the “hello, hello, hello” hook on “Hello, I’m Right Here” carries strange hints of the “British whine” that Sara recalls their teenage voices carrying in High School. On the electronic bounce of “You Go Away and I Don’t Mind,” the stripped-back production gives the juvenile, baffling opening lyrics (“I’m complicated, I was raised by icons”) nowhere to hide.On “Don’t Believe…,” however, they strike the right balance between the clumsy originality of the song that Sara says she wrote in 1995, at age 15, and the polished pros they are now. The melodrama of the chorus (“I belong”) is muted, filtering the pain of teenagerhood through refined adult tastes. There’s a radical kind of self-acceptance to honoring your goofy and heartbreaking teenage sentiments with such seriousness. Sara recently told the Guardian that she has a lot of “self-hatred” and “internalized homophobia” stemming from her difficult high school years, but that revisiting the music and memories of the time—rather than embarrassing her as much as she expected—helped her to love herself. “I’m so amazed at what that person accomplished, knowing that inside they were really, really damaged.”The fact that these songs have been interpreted by their writers 20 years later creates a layer of knowing poignancy, such as when Tegan sings, “I wonder if someday, we'll just be a memory?” on “I Know I’m Not...,” or when Sara sings “What if I become all of the horrible things that I said I would never be?” on the delicate “Please Help Me.” The sting of their adolescent fears is softened both by the heightened shimmer of the production, and by the very fact that we know how this story ends. Compare the gentle, winking nature of the line “Right now, I wish I was older” on “Hello, I’m Right Here,” to the brute force of Billie Eilish—still in the thick of all-encompassing young turmoil—singing about wishing she could be someone else. Memories of the very real pain and passion we felt as teenagers become cool enough to touch when we’re older. In Tegan and Sara’s hands, they become mantras, glimmering and hopeful and full of sparkle.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-09-27,7.1
Laurie Anderson,Songs From the Bardo,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=experimental"">Experimental</a>","When his brother-in-law died in a refugee camp in India, Tibetan singer and musician Tenzin Choegyal joined his sister in mourning. Tibetan Buddhists believe that when someone dies, their consciousness wanders through an in-between phase called the bardo for seven weeks before transitioning to a new life. This journey can be disorienting and frightening. To help guide his brother-in-law’s consciousness toward rebirth, Buddhist monks read aloud from The Bardo Thodol, also known as The Tibetan Book of the Dead, over the course of 49 days. “The ritual performance and recital of The Bardo Thodol by the monks transformed my sister from a devastated person to someone who gained conviction in her life again,” Choegyal writes in the liner notes for Songs From the Bardo. “The whole process was as therapeutic as anything I have ever observed in my life.”Over the past 15 years, Choegyal has explored the power of The Bardo Thodol in a variety of musical projects. Songs From the Bardo is the latest manifestation and finds Choegyal in collaboration with multidisciplinary artist Laurie Anderson and composer Jesse Paris Smith. Anderson acts as the guide, reading passages from The Bardo Thodol translated into English by Choegyal. The unknowable expanse of the bardo is invoked by Choegyal and Smith through vibrations summoned from a variety of particularly resonant instruments.Resonance is the closest that sound gets to touch. Lyrics can describe a caress, but reverberation can move air and bodies in ways that viscerally recall the breath of a loved one on the nape of the neck. Throughout much of Songs From the Bardo, it is the soothing drone tones of Choegyal’s Tibetan singing bowls and Smith’s crystal bowls that hold the space. The album’s songs flow into one another with little regard for beginnings or endings, just as The Bardo Thodol describes the journey of the consciousness through death to the next life. On “Heart Sutra Song – Gone Beyond,” Choegyal’s plucking of the dranyen, a Tibetan stringed instrument, provides a grounding counterpoint to Anderson’s inquisitive violin and guest musician Rubin Kodhel’s brooding cello. Over the strings, Choegyal sings part of the Heart Sutra in Sanskrit; his natural vibrato makes for one of the most stirring moments on the album. Elsewhere, Anderson’s recital is also deeply resonant. Her words often hang in the air for a split second after they leave her mouth. Over Smith’s gently rousing piano on “Lotus Born, No Need to Fear,” Anderson imbues each description, including “a fish rolling in hot sand,” with such emotion that it floods the mind.“Listen without distraction” is a refrain that Anderson repeats throughout Songs From the Bardo, and one that occasionally made me wonder if the album would have benefitted from using her gift for spoken word more sparingly. The interplay between the three collaborators’ instrumental contributions is so absorbing that maybe it doesn’t always need the narration; the spiritual guidance is apparent in the resonance itself.That said, dissonance plays as an important role as resonance on the album, especially in its second half. On “Dancing With the Crescent Knife,” Choegyal’s low chant rolls underneath creaking strings that, along with Anderson’s theatrical storytelling, bring to life the most disconcerting phase of the bardo. The spoken word on Songs of the Bardo, it is important to note, draws exclusively from the Chonyid Bardo, the part of The Bardo Thodol that describes the various spirits, including “blood-drinking wrathful deities,” that one’s consciousness encounters in the bardo. “Natural Form of Emptiness” illuminates those spirits further. Choegyal plays the lingbu (a Tibetan bamboo flute) like the guiding call of a bird, as if to say, This way, this way. Then the repeated crash of a gong signals a warning, but Anderson encourages the listener to hold their ground. “Awakened one, when projections appear like this, do not be afraid,” she recites. Then, later, “They only arise out of the spontaneous play of your mind.”The spontaneous play of your mind. These words hold particular weight at a time when systemic injustice, existential crises, and self-commodification pull the psyche in a thousand different directions at once. Anxiety, stress, depression, and a general sense of paralysis are common complaints of everyday people, and are without fail capitalized on by the very institutions and corporations that purport to support us. Insomnia, a smaller but related complaint and something I’ve experienced recently, can feel like being trapped in an in-between state. I listened to Songs of the Bardo on repeat when my eyes were burning and my head felt clogged, and it helped. The album’s contemplative pace—designed for listening in solitude, not playing in the background—cracked open just enough mental space to provide relief, and for that I am very grateful. While based on a text to help the recently deceased reach rebirth, Songs of the Bardo is very much an album about life; a salve as much as a guide.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-09-27,8.4
Girl Band,The Talkies,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","After laying dormant for nearly a half decade, Irish quartet Girl Band open their new album with a self-administered stethoscope test. “Prolix” isn’t so much a song as a diagnosis—for nearly two minutes, we hear nothing but frontman Dara Kiely’s breathing over an ominous, reverberating drone. But as the track goes on, Kiely‘s breaths turn harder, faster, and louder, until he’s desperately gulping air like a desert roamer sucking on their canteen. It’s the sound of pure, visceral panic—which is to say, on their first album in four years, Girl Band are in perfect health.“Prolix” isn’t staged—it’s a document of Kiely's actual panic attack in the studio. And coming from an artist who’s made no secret of his mental-health struggles—which precipitated the band’s extended hiatus—the track is a grim reminder that, even though Kiely feels well enough to resume his musical career, anxiety is an insidious affliction that can creep up at any time without warning. But the process of airing out his issues in the press and in past songs has made Kiely less interested in exploring them through his music now—when writing The Talkies, he deliberately avoided the use of the words “I” or “you” to avoid the painful introspection they may trigger. But while Girl Band are no longer explicitly talking about psychosis, they’re still experts at sonically communicating how it feels, through screeching sensory assaults that hit like a migraine and relentlessly pulsate like a heart racing out of control.More so than 2015’s Holding Hands With Jamie, The Talkies finds each member functioning less like a typical musician and more like a loose lever on a console, crashing in and dropping out of the mix at random moments. Guitarist Alan Duggan has completely unlearned the art of riffs and solos, using his instrument solely for textural dissonance—the more nauseating, the better. Bassist Daniel Fox deals exclusively in gut-rumbling frequencies, while drummer Adam Faulkner avoids the snare like it might be rigged with electric shocks. The result is drained of any rock-band formalism, all scrap-metal clang and kick-drum thump teetering on collapse.Kiely‘s lyrics mimic this deconstructionist approach, atomizing everyday scenes and conversations into fragments. On The Talkies, you’ll hear references to pop-cultural icons like Ricki Lake, Zinedine Zidane, Bert and Ernie, and the Byrds, though when fed through Kiely’s cut-and-paste filter, they become disembodied figures thrown into a parade of freaks that includes “mental zoo boy,” “Crunchy Percy,” and the “bloke with The Man and The Legend shirt.” Kiely clearly delights in the beautiful absurdities of the English language: The post-apocalyptic chain-gang chant “Aibohphobia” references the (not officially recognized) fear of palindromes while piling them onto prospective victims (“Cain a Maniac! Salt an Atlas! Strap on No parts! Bird Rib!”) with all the merciless fervor of a waterboard interrogation.Kiely doesn’t so much front the group as submit himself to them: As “Couch Combover” builds into a seasick, distortion-soaked stomp, it sounds like Kiely is puking and crying at the same time. But later in that same song, the squall subsides to reveal Kiely gently singing the track’s chorus, offering a glimpse of the pop singer trapped in a noise band’s body.By the time we reach The Talkies’ tumultuous seven-minute climax “Prefab Castle,” Girl Band’s balance of composure and cataclysm has tipped toward the latter. The emergency sirens are ringing out, the walls are closing in, and Kiely reverts to his panic-attack gasp. And yet as the song begins its final descent, Kiely recites a mantra with unnerving calm: “When it’s depressed/Still in love/When it’s happy/Still in love/When it’s all sad/Still in love/When it’s anxious/Still in love.” It may not be everyone’s definition of a peaceful conclusion, but after all the punishment Kiely’s endured over the course of this record, it’s a minor miracle he’s still breathing at all.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-09-27,8.0
Chastity Belt,Chastity Belt,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","Chastity Belt were roughly 100 miles from Asheville, North Carolina when lead vocalist Julia Shapiro reached her breaking point. Just before touring their last album, 2017’s I Used to Spend So Much Time Alone, Shapiro split up with her long-term partner and had a possibly cancerous portion of her thyroid removed. She toughed it out on the road for about a month, when her bandmates—guitarist Lydia Lund, bassist Annie Truscott, and drummer Gretchen Grimm—collectively decided it was time to hit pause. So, the Seattle indie rockers cancelled the remainder of the tour, simply citing “health concerns,” and Shapiro sought comfort by driving two hours east to stay with an Asheville friend. Shapiro was experiencing an existential dilemma of sorts: “I had a lot of questions going through my mind,” she explained. “‘Should I be doing something else with my life? What else could I do?’”Shapiro relays this anecdote on “Rav-4,” a highlight from Chastity Belt’s self-titled fourth album. “Fooled them all, then hit a wall/Lay in Kate’s bed, it’s true what she said/That giving up can take some guts,” she sings. “Lost my mind and much more, but who’s keeping score?” The rest of Chastity Belt reveals some of the “much more” Shapiro feels is vanishing: her ambition, her hopefulness, and maybe most of all, herself. But even when Shapiro was at her lowest, Chastity Belt never seriously considered calling it quits; their friendship has been going strong for over a decade now, and their combined force feels more evocative and pointed than ever. They’ve long abandoned the crude wit of their 2013 debut, but Chastity Belt still maintains that closeness of hanging out with friends in your living room, engrossed by each others’ ruminations until the wee hours of the morning.Friendship is a recurring theme on Chastity Belt, from “Rav-4”’s Kate to “Elena”—named after the pseudonymous Italian novelist Elena Ferrante, whose most well-known works centered around the companionship of women as their rural Neapolitan town collapsed at their feet. Chastity Belt seem to liken their own emotional turmoil to Ferrante’s ruins: “Changed all your plans to line up with his/Hanging onto every word he says/Measured your self worth/By his judgements,” Shapiro sings, an eerie retrospective after the collegiate tribulations of No Regerts and the whatever-forever demeanor of 2015’s Time to Go Home.This heightened self-awareness also presents itself in tracks like “Effort,” where Grimm envisions an immaculate version of herself while seeking refuge in a new relationship—perhaps in an attempt to avoid facing her own insecurities. “Running for cover, into another/It’s not what I need, but it seems to be what I want,” Shapiro sings. “I could be perfect, I could exist/Just how you need me to be in this moment.” Chastity Belt’s lyrics have always been clever, but here they attain a sort of nonchalant wisdom. “Been counting on someone, but I counted wrong/So now I’m feeling pretty dumb,” goes one particularly jarring line of “Half-Hearted,” before reaching a resolution in closer “Pissed Pants”: “Now I’m obsessing over endings/And all the things that are holding me back/You said, so casually, ‘Everything just works out.’” Chastity Belt’s best lyrics are just as casual and profound.The album was co-produced by Jay Som’s Melina Duterte, resulting in Chastity Belt at their dreamiest and most tranquil. As far as their Pacific Northwest predecessors go, there’s little evidence of their livelier original inspirations like Sleater-Kinney and Autoclave, instead leaning on hushed Elliott Smith-ish delivery, lush reverb, and traces of strings. The album’s lethargy can feel tedious, a little lacking in contrast; most of its songs stroll past at similar tempos and volumes, rarely culminating in moments that could be considered “big.” But Shapiro has something to say, and Chastity Belt is largely confessional; her words are the focus here, and these simple, serene landscapes are a fitting backdrop to hear her loud and clear.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",2019-09-27,7.1
