King Princess,Cheap Queen,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=pop"">Pop/R&amp;B</a>","By now, Mikaela Straus’ artistic predicament has become uncannily familiar: A young unknown with a fresh, infectious sound releases a song that catches fire. Streams rack up, fame arrives overnight; the pressure’s on to articulate an artistic identity, cook up a debut album, and make good on the promise of that first hit, fast—all while contending with the gaze of several million curious onlookers. If Straus, who’s better known as King Princess, wanted to compare notes on the ups and downs of a viral breakout, she could do so with a fairly spectacular peer group that includes Maggie Rogers, Billie Eilish, and Clairo.Straus’ story has an added layer of complexity. Last year, the 20-year-old singer-songwriter rose up on the shoulders of her song “1950,” a sticky, Harry Styles-cosigned debut that took inspiration from classic queer literature and opened with a nod to her sexual orientation: “I hate it when dudes try to chase me.” On its heels came “Talia,” a bit of liquor-wet, post-breakup revelry directed to a conspicuously female subject, and the self-explanatory single “Pussy Is God.” Within months, King Princess was not just a burgeoning pop phenom, but a burgeoning queer idol.In the historically sanitized landscape of pop music, queer expression is undeniably radical, particularly how Straus does it—by naming and gendering her desire in a way that, not long ago, few dared to. And if Straus is fazed by the burden of representation, she doesn’t show it. Her debut album—that first true test of her artistry—is titled Cheap Queen, borrowing a term from drag culture, and on its cover, she appears with her face done up in drag queen glam, down to the painted-on beauty mark. The title track, she says, is a tribute to her squad, all cheap queens in their own right. (Straus, whose father runs Brooklyn’s Mission Sound studio, inherited a leg up in the industry, so it’s a bit cheeky of her to make a personal brand of scrappiness—but then, cheekiness is part of her brand, too.) Like any good pop song, “Cheap Queen” strikes a balance between specificity and relatability. It shouts out its community without wading into identity politics, instead cultivating, through its inclusive warmth and effortless swagger, a stoner-pop appeal likely to resonate with anyone who’s ever stayed up drinking and smoking with pals.Thematically, though, “Cheap Queen”—originally one of the album’s sharp, economical interludes, until Straus’ team persuaded her to expand it—stands apart. On the whole, the album is more concerned with lovers than with friends. Sequenced as a chronological narrative, Cheap Queen loosely follows a fraught renegotiation of space between exes; the particulars aren’t quite so interesting as the emotions they draw out. Straus has noted her eagerness to “write about getting my heart smashed,” and she repeatedly delivers on the drama of that declaration. “Homegirl,” a schmaltzy, vibraphone-embellished ballad, tracks the triangulation of glances between Straus and the boys who are eyeing the same woman at a party—the kind of gathering where close quarters reveal vast emotional distance. The gulf between Straus and her love interest widens as she considers forgotten possessions unlikely to be reclaimed (“Isabel’s Moment”) and nervously awaits a text unlikely to arrive (“Watching My Phone”).The latter song’s clincher is an admission of inadequacy: “I can’t be the million girls you’re going to meet.” The meekness is gutting; its narrator is barely recognizable as the same person who earlier claimed to be “getting too cocky, since everyone wants me,” who wrote off her ex with a sweetly condescending, “You’re probably just a fan now, babe.” But embracing opposing energies is the King Princess way. She is confident and vulnerable, cool and earnest. As her chosen moniker suggests, she’s masculine and feminine, swaggering and soft, posing for Playboy as both cheerleader and jock. She’s posing for Playboy, a bastion of the male gaze that her widely broadcasted sexuality belies.In particular, Cheap Queen plays on a tension between old and new. Straus and her Gen-Z peers grew up listening to Drake, Beyoncé, and Taylor Swift, but Straus’ industry-adjacent upbringing also exposed her to ’70s rock bands including Led Zeppelin and T. Rex. Like Styles, who helped precipitate her fame, she seems eager to cut her modern pop sensibility with doses of historicism. On Cheap Queen, the drum pads and Auto-Tune harmonics that defined her first singles are still part of the mix, but the computer isn’t her primary tool. There’s a hint of Janis Joplin when Straus layers in blues guitar and organ or teases the occasional snarl out of her otherwise silky voice. Latter-day rock prophet Father John Misty drops by to handle drums on “Ain’t Together,” a crisp, handsome tune with Beatles-esque eccentricity in its (digitally approximated) Mellotron fills and densely layered backing vocals.Still, Straus is a distinctly contemporary creator, versed in samples and pitch-shifts and interludes—songs as short as post-digital attention spans—that house some of her most intriguing musical ideas. To the extent that viral success is explicable, it seems sensible that hers continues to hold. As Cheap Queen makes plain, she’s not an ingénue with one great idea—she has a few dozen of them, informed by sources spanning decades and genres. There are moments when she slips up—“Watching My Phone,” with its lugubrious strings and wistful choral embellishments, feels particularly overworked—and she isn’t breaking ground in pop by disregarding its supposed borders. But where post-genre stream-baiters pull their numbers by anesthetizing distinctive sounds, King Princess pulls hers by playing up their contrasts.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)","[Verse 1]
Nobody told me
To sit down and shut up
And take this shit slowly
I'm so bad with attention
So my good intentions
Get bad when you hold me

[Chorus]
I get too tough on myself
Sitting alone, making fun of myself

[Verse 2]
You want that young love
Like passing me notes, hon'
That shit that you dream of
I'm just sitting at home
Smoking joints like it's my job
'Cause that's what my dream was

[Chorus]
I get too tough on myself
Sitting alone, making fun of myself
And is it so wrong to just want someone else?
(I was thinking you and I could get together)
(I was thinking maybe you could do me better)
And is it so wrong to just want someone else?
(I was thinking you and I could get together)
(I was thinking maybe you could do me better)

[Bridge]
Tough on myself
I get too
I get too tough on myself
I get too tough on mys—

[Chorus]
I get too tough on myself
(I was thinking you and I could get together)
(I was thinking maybe you could do me better)
Sitting alone making fun of myself
(I was thinking you and I could get together)
(I was thinking maybe you could do me better)
And is it so wrong to just want someone else?
(I was thinking you and I could get together)
(I was thinking maybe you could do me better)
And is it so wrong to just want someone else?
(I was thinking you and I could get together)
(I was thinking maybe you could do me better)You say you want me back
And I don't usually entertain such useless phrases, baby
I thought I had the facts
And I don't usually entertain such useless phrases, baby[Verse 1]
(Cheap queen)
I've been alright
I've just been doing the same shit I've always liked (Smiling for the audience)
Like smoking and movies and homies who bring me wine
I've been going out too much (Queen)
And talking 'bout myself too much (Oh, smiling for the audience)

[Chorus]
I can be good sometimes
I'm a cheap queen
I can be what you like
And I can be bad sometimes
I'm a real queen
I can make grown men cry
I can be good sometimes
I'm a cheap queen
I can be what you like
And I can be bad sometimes
I'm a real queen
I can make grown men cry

[Verse 2]
Makin' my name (Queen)
All of my girls get up early and stay out late (Queen)
They drive all the way to the west side to see my face (How did I do it?)
That's good love (Good love, good love)
And I ain't no big baller when it's fake friends you're callin'

[Chorus]
I can be good sometimes
I'm a cheap queen
I can be what you like
And I can be bad sometimes
I'm a real queen
I can make grown men cry
I can be good sometimes
I'm a cheap queen
I can be what you like
And I can be bad sometimes
I'm a real queen
I can make grown men cry

[Bridge]
I'm gettin' too cocky since everyone wants me (Queen)
It's harder to be myself (Queen, queen)
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do (Smiling)
But I see you love me (Queen)
It's better than money to know that you call me out (Cheap queen)
But when the money's out
I can make grown men cry

[Chorus]
I can be good sometimes
I'm a cheap queen
I can be what you like
And I can be bad sometimes
I'm a real queen
I can make grown men cry
I can be good sometimes
I'm a cheap queen
I can be what you like
And I can be bad sometimes
I'm a real queen
I can make grown men cry

How did I do it?
Queen[Verse 1]
I know you're with me
And I'd love to see someone else call you
And all this in between
You think it's hard for me to tell you're fallin'
Oh, we're fallin'

[Pre-Chorus]
And bein' chill, bein' chill with you
Oh, it kills, I ain't chill at all, at all

[Chorus]
We say ""I love you,"" but we ain't together
Do you think labels make it taste much better?
Darlin', do you think that if I talk enough
I will make you wanna be mine?
We ain't together

[Verse 2]
Cut off all these hoes (Ah)
Baby, you don't gotta worry 'bout nothing (Ah)
'Cause everybody knows (Ah)
That you and I got that somethin' (Ah)

And bein' chill, bein' chill with you (Ah)
Oh, it kills, I ain't chill at all, at all

We say ""I love you,"" but we ain't together
Do you think labels make it taste much better?
Darlin', do you think that if I talk enough
I will make you wanna be mine?
'Til you don't say you and I ain't together, babe
Ain't together
Ain't together[Intro]
Do you wanna see me cry for you?
Do you wanna see me cry for you?
Do you wanna see me cry for you?

[Chorus]
I think it's cuter when I dance now
I think I'm nicer to my friends now
(Do you wanna see me cry for you?)
I think I'm working through the stress now
I wanna put a million songs out
(Do you wanna see me cry for you?)
I keep my money in my hands now
And I feel better with my heart out
(Do you wanna see me cry for you?)
And you're probably just a fan now
Took a minute, but I found out
(Do you wanna see me cry for you?)
I think it's cuter when I
I think it's cuter when I
(Do you wanna see me cry for you?)

[Chorus]
It's cuter when I dance now
I think I'm nicer to my friends now
I think I'm working through the stress now
I wanna put a million songs out
I keep my money in my hands now
And I feel better with my heart out
And you're probably just a fan now, babe
Took a minute, but I found out
Took a minute, but I found out
Oh[Verse 1]
They stare when you walk in the room
Like they're looking at Heaven
Oh, you know that those boys will do
More than just look if you let them

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't wanna be like them with you
But you still look at me like him

[Chorus]
And you taste like danger, but I feel so safe in your arms
And I like the way that you talk slow
Spelling my name with your tongue, so
You don't have to say it
We're friends at the party, I'll give you my body at home

[Verse 2]
Oh, I stare when you walk in the room
Like I'm scared to forget you
If you're thinking that I'm gonna
Act like those boys, I would never

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't wanna be like them with you
But you still look at me like him

[Chorus]
And you taste like danger, but I feel so safe in your arms
And I like the way that you talk, slow
Spelling my name with your tongue, so
You don't have to say it
We're friends at the party, I'll give you my body at home[Verse 1]
You call when you want it
Everyone wants something from your soul on the molly
Someone's friend is talking like they know, oh, you’re on it
I just want to be your pretty girl when you want it

[Chorus]
'Cause I can only think about you
And what it's like to walk around you
And why they like to talk about you
’Cause I can only think about you

[Verse 2]
You know what you want
It's only 'bout the money and control
Can't step off it, someone else will cop it
Like it's gold, you're a prophet
Someone's gonna profit
Don't you know I just want it, uh

[Chorus]
I can only think about you
And what it’s like to walk around you
And why they like to talk about you
’Cause I can only think about you
'Cause I can only think about you
And what it’s like to walk around you
And why they like to talk about you
'Cause I can only think about you

[Bridge]
Oh, no apologies, twisting your word and your prophecy
Oh, and honestly, it's the price of the prodigy you wanna be
Oh, no apologies, twisting your words and your prophecy
Oh, and honestly

[Chorus]
I can only think about you
And what it's like to walk around you
And why they like to talk about you
’Cause I can only think about you
'Cause I can only think about you
And what it's like to walk around you
And why they like to talk about you
'Cause I can only think about you

[Outro]
Oh, think about you
(It's the price of the prodigy you wanna be)
Thinking about you
(Do-do-do)
Think about
(It's the price of the prodigy you wanna be)
Oh, thinking about you, oh
(It's the price of the prodigy you wanna be)
'Cause I can only think about you
(It's the price of the prodigy you wanna be)
Oh, I can only think about you, yeah[Verse: King Princes]
Maybe it's over, maybe it's not
But hope is a thing that you find when you're sober
And your clothes are still in my drawers
Like you're haunting my home
I'd be amazed if you walked through those doors
Like ""Hey, how's it going?""
But you haven't come over
Maybe I'm dumb
But you can't choose your love like a phone number
And I'm still trying to draw all the lines
Through my friends and my lovers
It ain't clear how we feel
When we spend all this time with each other

[Outro: King Princess & Tobias Jesso Jr.]
Is it how it's gonna be?
Is it how it's gonna be?
Is it how it's gonna be?
Is it how it's gonna be?
Is it how it's gonna be?
Is it how it's gonna be?
How it's gonna be[Verse 1]
I don't ever trust nobody
No, I don’t ever trust, but I trust you
Ain't that great?
And I'm still dumb when no one’s watching
I bet you're cool when no one's watching you
I guess it's fate

[Chorus]
And she said, ""Meet me at the party""
But I don't know nobody
And she said I'm getting there
They treat you like a ticket
But I just wanna kick it
And honey, I'll take you there
Oh, when everyone starts calling for me
Oh, I only pick up for you

[Verse 2]
Well, I don't ever trust nobody
And they think I’m cute and kinda funny
Oh, I guess that’s fair
And I get dumb when you start talking
And one more night and I might fall for you
Oh, I'm there

[Chorus]
And she said, ""Meet me at the party""
But I don’t know nobody
And she said I'm getting there
They treat you like a ticket
But I just wanna kick it
And honey, I'll take you there
Oh, when everyone starts calling for me
Oh, I only pick up for you

[Bridge]
Watching me slip over words, it kinda hurts
For what it's worth
I just wanna be with you, babe
I don’t know nobody
But she said I'm getting there (Oh)

[Outro]
And she said, ""Meet me at the party""
But I don't know nobody, baby
Watching me slip over words, it kinda hurts
For what it's worth
I just wanna be with you (They treat you like a ticket)
But I just wanna kick it
Watching me slip over words, it kinda hurts
For what it's worth
I just wanna be with you, yeah
I just wanna be with you
I don't know nobody
But she said I'm getting there (Oh)
I just wanna be with you
I just wanna be with you, babe
I just wanna be with you, babe
I just wanna be with you
I just wanna be with you[Verse 1]
And I know you
Destroy the things you love to save yourself
And I'm passing through your life
And I know you
Can't bear to see me go, but make me leave
In the middle of the night

[Pre-Chorus]
(Maybe it will change, but)
You ain't all I've ever wanted in a package
And your independence throws me off my balance
And I'm alone

[Chorus]
Watching my phone
Thinking 'bout you, baby
Watching my phone
Thinking 'bout you

[Verse 2]
And I know I
Can't be the million girls you're gonna meet
And I think that's alright
I apologize
For holding you so tight you couldn't breathe
And thinking you'd be fine

[Pre-Chorus]
(Maybe it will change, but)
Oh, you ain't all I've ever wanted in a package
And your independence throws me off my balance
And I'm alone

[Chorus]
Watching my phone
Thinking 'bout you, baby
Watching my phone
Thinking 'bout you

[Bridge]
Watching my phone
Thinking 'bout you, baby
Watching my phone
(Maybe it will change, but)

[Outro]
Watching my phone
Thinking 'bout you, baby
Watching my phone
Thinking 'bout you
Thinking 'bout you
Thinking 'bout you
(Maybe it will change, but)[Verse 1]
Heard you saw my tricks
I know I gave you superstar
And from the barricade
I've heard you move your hips
But you should probably learn your place
'Cause this isn't it, baby

[Chorus]
You destroyed my heart
Now I want somebody good
'Cause you lost the part
Now I want somebody good

[Verse 2]
I could get you back (That's cute)
And we could probably reenact
But I'm a better fag, and you're an amateur
(She seems so lost)
And it's cute you wanna be my friend
It would never work, baby

[Chorus]
You destroyed my heart
Now I want somebody good
'Cause you lost the part
Now I want somebody, want somebody good

[Bridge]
What you saw, what you caused
And you seem so sad like it's all my fault
But it's not 'cause you're gone
It's the best I had, but I'm moving on
Like a pro (She seems so lost), it's my job
You can break my trust, I just build my funds
And it's time, give me up
And you seem so sad, but it's not my fault

[Chorus]
'Cause you, you broke my heart
Now I want somebody good
'Cause you lost the part
Now I want somebody good
Destroyed my heart
Now I want somebody good (She seems so nice)
'Cause you lost the part
Now I want somebody good (She seems so nice)
Destroyed my heart
Now I want somebody good (She seems so nice)
'Cause you lost the part
Now I want somebody good

[Outro]
She seems so lost
She seems so lost
She seems so lost[Verse 1]
I need you to search my clothing
Pat me down and feel the molding
'Cause underneath this table feels so good to me
And I need you to be my motor
And run me 'til I can't go further
'Cause every turn you take is just exciting me

[Chorus]
And ain't I the best you had?
And I'll let you throw it down, hit the back
Tell me I need respect
And you know that I'm around, I'm your pet
Ain't I the best you had?
And I'll let you throw it down, hit the back
Tell me you need respect
'Cause you know that I'm around, I'm your pet

[Verse 2]
Well, I'm a star, but you're an icon
A dirty girl with lots of passion
Staring at my fingers while I talk to you
And I don't care if you degrade me
'Cause after all, you are my safety
And everything you touch just feels like yours to me

[Chorus]
Ain't I the best you had?
And I'll let you throw it down, hit the back
Tell me you need respect
'Cause you know that I'm around, I'm your pet
Ain't I the best you had?

[Bridge]
(Ain't I the best you've ever had?)
It's really been nice to meet ya, babe
(Take my heart and hit the back)
(Ain't I the best you had?)
I think that I really need ya, baby
(Ain't I the best you've ever had?)
I think that I really need ya, baby
(Take my heart and hit the back)

[Chorus]
Ain't I the best you had?
And I'll let you throw it down, hit the back
Tell me you need respect
'Cause you know that I'm around, I'm your pet

[Outro]
Ain't I the best you had?
(Ain't I the best you've ever had?)
Ain't I the best you had?
(Take my heart and hit the back)
Ain't I the best you had?
(Ain't I the best you've ever had?)
(Take my heart and hit the back)[Verse 1]
If this is love
I want my money back
'Cause I could use the check
To spend it on a better heart
To wear upon my sleeve
And it might take a sec
My world's become a mess
I'm second-guessing all the things
I used to wanna be

[Chorus]
So if you think it's love, it is
And if you think it's trust, it is
And if you think it's love, it is
It is

[Verse 2]
If you want trust
I'll need my conscience back
She got so out of whack
My broken back has carried all
The weight I thought I'd need
And it might take a sec
My world's been changing fast
The normal things I never thought
I'd miss are obsolete

[Chorus]
So if you think it's love, it is
And if you think it's trust, it is
And if you think it's love, it is
It is

[Outro]
And if you think it's love, it is
And if you think it's trust, it is
And if you think it's love, it is
And if you think it's trust, it is
And if you think it's love, it is
And if you think it's trust, it is
And if you think it's love, it is
And if you think it's trust, it is
And if you think it's love, it is
And if you think it's trust, it is
And if you think it's love, it is
And if you think it's trust, it is (Yeah)",2019-10-28,7.4
Donato Dozzy,12H,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=electronic"">Electronic</a>","For over 15 years, Italian producer Donato Dozzy has masterfully ranged from tech house to trance to straight techno. But at his core, he is a minimalist, gleefully finding the strangest, most archaic element to zoom in on, turning any mole hill into Monte Bianco. His beatific ambient techno collaboration with fellow producer Neel, 2012’s Voices From the Lake, took as its starting point a single incident, a live set to be performed at Japan’s infamous Labyrinth festival. And in the past few years, Dozzy’s zoomed in even further, relentlessly exploring every imaginable facet of the mouth harp, the 303, and Anna Caragnano’s singing voice across full-length albums.So it makes a certain kind of sense that a single object lies at the heart of his latest epic, 12H: the Armando Trovajoli - Music Bridge in Rome. While plans for the structure date back to 1929, the bridge was only completed in 2008. It’s the lone steel bridge that runs over the River Tiber into the historic center of Rome. This release on Lorenzo Senni’s Presto!? label is culled from material that Dozzy recorded and assembled for a sound installation designed for 24 speakers that ran the length of the colonnade of the bridge. 12H clocks in at almost 100 minutes, at times evoking the immersive, exquisitely detailed ambience of Voices from the Lake, but without the same breathtaking vistas and sumptuous peaks.The set opens with Dozzy in resplendent, shimmering ambient mode, all body-dissolving washes, tingling small bells, electronics that mimic the sound of frogs at night, and slow-moving arpeggios. Other elements pop up, like running water and clattering wind chimes, before “12H.3” introduces a gentle pulse and quivering synth line, only to have it splash back into gurgly water sounds and electronics.A magnificent highlight comes on “12H.5,” which could be a leftover from Sintetizzatrice, his collaboration with Caragnano. The track painstakingly layers her gossamer breaths, building a sigh into a skyscraper.  As that piece dissipates, the first smattering of percussion finally enters, nearly 45 minutes into the album, the hand drums pinging about the stereo field like a gentle tribute to E2-E4. Usually when drums enter Dozzy’s mixes, they elevate the proceedings to an unimaginable new high. Here, they don’t really add much in the way of emotion or release.The throbs of “12H.8” soon get submerged by field recordings of insects rustling in the distance. The metallic thrums and acid stabs that punctuate “12H.9” are texturally intriguing, though they too soon fall to the wayside. We’re left to wonder what it might have sounded like had Dozzy pushed a few elements further or higher (as when Dozzy dropped a masterful techno rework of “12H.5” as a single earlier this year), rather than let the strictures of minimalism tamp everything down. The sounds of bridge traffic dovetail nicely with 12H’s kosmische-esque closing track, but like most urban congestion problems, it just takes far too long to get there.",,2019-10-28,6.8
Cigarettes After Sex,Cry,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=experimental"">Experimental</a>","It feels almost like a novelty these days for a dude to write an album entirely about being extremely horny. Men don’t make music about sex the way they used to. We are far past the epoch of Serge Gainsbourg writing pop songs that involved Jane Birkin or Brigitte Bardot mimicking the sounds of orgasm. People have more or less collectively agreed that rendering women as pure sex objects in music doesn’t need to happen so much anymore. Greg Gonzalez, the frontman of the noir dream-pop band Cigarettes After Sex, must not have gotten the memo. He operates within a space of midcentury sexual anachronism. His second record, Cry, is a 41-minute dream about Penthouse pets and women in silken underthings, filtered through chiaroscuro and top-shelf whiskey. There is a universe where this raciness could conceivably offer a reprieve from indie rock’s occasional prudishness. Unfortunately, Gonzalez’s candor about his desire comes off as lifeless and borderline asinine.This is clear from the first play of the record. The bleak textures, like those of the band’s debut, have been airlifted from the darkest corners of dream-pop music. There are notes of Violet Indiana and the Verve circa A Storm in Heaven, as well as more obvious tips of the hat to Angelo Badalamenti and David Lynch. “Kiss It Off Me,” the album’s second song, uses subterranean synth parts that are uncannily similar to the ones on the Twin Peaks soundtrack. The intrigue and Lynchian darkness pretty much stop once we meet the apple of Gonzalez’s eye, a protagonist as two-dimensional as a piece of paper peeling off a picnic table in a light breeze. “I could see you were walking slow/Drinking a Slurpee/In a peach baseball cap/Falling in my lap/You were so thirsty,” Gonzalez sings, with unearned wistfulness. He yearns to make her forget about “all of those rich fuckboys” she tends to date, and by the end of the song, she’s biting her lip and begging for it before she heads off to the gym in the morning. If there is anything romantic about this encounter, it is washed away by the song’s utter inability to deviate from overused ’90s pastiche—or, more importantly, to represent the woman in question as anything other than some chick who loves to work out and have sex.Then there’s “Hentai,” a song that’s literally about anime porn. Specifically, about a hentai video he described to his paramour the first time they “made love,” about “a girl who as soon as she made you come/Could show you the future and tell you your fortune.” The scene setting could almost be funny, but there’s scant irony in Gonzalez’s delivery. The sound of the song is as delicate as an antique plate gathering dust on a shelf: High notes on electric guitars are languidly plucked, and the bassline is a slow IV drip that gives you goosebumps. Then there’s the question of Gonzalez’s voice, a truly lovely and androgynous tenor that’s wasted on lines like these. You could lose yourself in the sound, if losing yourself is akin to collapsing on an overly plush bed. “Pure” is an equally banal and pornographic sketch of a song. Here, Gonzalez’s woman wears a white bodysuit and has wet hair.  Long story short, she goes down on him, and then they go stare out the window but all he can think about is how he got to see her naked. It’s the album’s closer, but it’s likely to leave you feeling nothing, other than perhaps blunted anger.Cry doesn’t evoke much in the name of passion. Unless, of course, passion is the same thing as wafting through depression, and sex is the means to fill that void. There is nothing wry about the way Gonzalez writes about sex. The album has almost zero sense of humor and is deadly serious in its execution. It’s important to write about sex on one’s own terms, and there are plenty of compelling ways to explore sexuality in song. The problem here is that the narrative of this record is essentially one giant, dull, and gross fantasy plucked from adolescent male puberty. It presents a vision of sex that comes from surfing Pornhub after school before your parents get home from work, and from looking at pictures of minimally clad Instagram influencers while waiting in line to get a flu shot. Gonzalez’s attempt to be honest about his experiences is far removed from the reality of what it is like to be sexually vulnerable in front of another person. Cry is a soulless and Styrofoam record as hollow as a booty-call text at 3 a.m. “Hey sexy, you up?” the record seems to beckon. It’s hardly an inviting proposition.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)","[Verse 1]
When I was young, I thought the world of you
You were all that I wanted then
It faded and I never saw you again
But I won’t forget the love we had

Come to me now
Don’t let me go
Stay by my side
Don’t let me go
Stay with me still
I’ve missed you so

When I was young, I thought the world of you
I was dumb to let you drift away

No one else could have the love we shared

Of all the boyfriends you got?
Know I make you forget

You always bite your lip
When you're feelin' it
As we move slowly

I need to stay alive
So sad that I could die

[Verse 3]
Couldn't say you didn’t want me there
When we were lyin’ in my bed that night
You were acting like a different person
As if, suddenly, you wanted to just be friends
I was hurting so I took a shower
So you couldn't hear me, knowing I had to cry
Sad to know that while my heart was breaking
You were sleeping normal, just vacant

[Chorus]
It’s leading me on, every time we touch
Leading me on, every time it hurts
Feeling so lonely, 'cause it's not enough
Missin' you only, ever since we fell in love[Verse 1]
There was a hentai video that I saw
I told you about the night that we first made love
About a girl who as soon as she made you cum
Would show you the future and tell you your fortune

[Chorus]
Beautiful hearts are in your eyes
I've been waiting for you to fall for me
And let me in your life
I've been waiting for you

[Verse 2]
Told you I wanted to die in an airplane crash
Over the ocean, thought it was romantic
But you didn't like it, thought it was stupid, ah
Thinking of me dead is making you feel bad

Beautiful hearts are in your eyes
I've been waiting for you to fall for me
And let me in your life
I've been waiting for you

[Chorus]
Beautiful hearts are in your eyes
I've been waiting for you to fall for me
And let me in your life
I've been waiting for you[Verse 1]
It's making you cry every time
You give your love to me this way
Saying you'd wait for me to stay
I know it hurts you

[Chorus]
But I need to tell you something
My heart just can't be faithful for long
I swear I'll only make you cry

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'd change for you someday
But I can't help the way I feel
Wish I was good
Wish that I could give you my love now

[Chorus]
But I need to tell you something
My heart just can't be faithful for long
I swear I'll only make you cry

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I need to tell you something
My heart just can't be faithful for long
I swear I'll only make you cry[Verse 1]
When I hold you close to me
I could always see a house by the ocean
Last night I could hear the waves
As I heard you say, ""All that I want is to be yours""

[Chorus]
Falling in love
Falling in love
Deeper than I've felt it before
With you, baby
I feel I'm falling in love with all my heart

[Verse 2]
Back when you were far away
We would go on dates to watch the same movie
And you were imagining sitting next to me
Holding my hand for the whole thing

[Chorus]
Falling in love
Falling in love
Deeper than I've felt it before
With you, baby
I feel I'm falling in love with all my heart

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Falling in love
Falling in love
Deeper than I've felt it before
With you, baby
I feel I'm falling in love with all my heart[Verse 1]
When you walk in the room
In a white bodysuit
And I say, ""Take it off""
Say it slow, me to watch

[Chorus]
Man, it's pure
Only your love could get me to fall
Burn as deep, get so hot
And it's so beautiful

[Verse 2]
And the TV is on
When we make love because
We get carried away
We don't care anyway

[Chorus]
Man, it's pure
Only your love could get me to fall
Burn as deep, get so hot
And it's so beautiful

[Verse 3]
Wrapped your head in a towel
But I watch you let it down
And it's all soaking wet
As you take me in your mouth
And we stare at the street
From the back balcony
But now all I can see
Is you undressing for me

[Chorus]
Man, it's pure
Only your love could get me to fall
Burn as deep, get so hot
And it's so beautiful",2019-10-28,4.0
Ali Barter,"Hello, I’m Doing My Best","<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=pop"">Pop/R&amp;B</a>","Though happily married and sober, Melbourne songwriter and guitarist Ali Barter wouldn’t dare write about anything so peaceful. Barter’s muse is the thrilling turbulence of young adulthood, and the lasting resonance of the bad decisions one makes in their early 20s. On her new record Hello, I’m Doing My Best, these themes coalesce with the confidence and immediacy of 2000s pop-rock. The result is an emotionally nuanced album that never takes itself too seriously.Barter’s debut, 2017’s A Suitable Girl, was a lovably slapdash collection of, in the words of one beloved teen film, “angry girl music of the indie-rock persuasion”—feminist pop-rock that angled for everywoman relatability. That formula worked well for Barter, with the singles “Girlie Bits” and “Cigarette” achieving modest success in her home country. Many of the songs on A Suitable Girl, though, suffered from a certain anonymity. Her bid for universality resulted in lines like “What’s a woman made of?/Something glorious”—well-intentioned but nevertheless a little hackneyed.Hello, I’m Doing My Best makes no such attempts, instead leaning full-tilt into Barter’s loose-cannon instincts. She draws herself as an indie rock Fleabag, a self-deprecating and hard-drinking flirt who texts her crushes at 3 a.m. and listens to “Malibu” to get through the hangover the next morning. From its earliest moments—the Hole reference comes in the very first line—Hello, I’m Doing My Best is appealingly frank. “Ur a Piece of Shit,” the second track, is a bombastic love letter to a friend in crisis: “You got your daddy issues,” Barter sings. “It made you real suspicious/That’s why you hacked in his account.” She wastes no time with poetics, and while it’s a risky move—she ends up rhyming “drugs” with “drugs”—it displays a kind of gonzo commitment to the album’s messy, diaristic heart.With loud and unadorned production, Hello, I’m Doing My Best taps into a current of emotive, candid pop-rock typified by the Josie and the Pussycats soundtrack and currently practiced by the likes of Charly Bliss and Bully. There’s not an ounce of crunch or grit here, just clean, sanded-down edges and lacquered finishes. The production—handled by Barter’s husband, Oscar Dawson of the band Holy Holy—adds an early-2000s patina, giving the record the pleasing accessibility of teen classics like Avril Lavigne’s Let Go.Hello, I’m Doing My Best often reads as a guidebook for young adults learning to navigate the world, and in that light, Barter’s no-bullshit lyricism is punkish and endearing. On “Ur a Piece of Shit,” for example, she gleefully calls on listeners to “put your hands up” for various messed-up teenage experiences, like “eating disorders,” “if a doctor touched you,” and “if it felt good to cut yourself.” In moments like these, Barter resembles a young Liz Phair, writing with a shamelessness that few songwriters since have really relished. Lines like, “I heard you like Tool, yeah/And you got really cool hair/And I think that you should be my boyfriend” feel directly indebted to Phair, and the chorus of “History of Boys” (“I used to get drunk and blackout/I used to get drunk and tell you I need you”), while hewing closer to pop than anything Phair wrote in her early days, owes its gutsiness to her.It helps that Barter never lets a linear personal narrative define these songs. The only time she writes about her now-husband, on “Backseat,” she revisits a time before they met, hinting at the future by declaring that “we’d be perrrrrfect” alongside a grandiose Guitar Hero-style solo. “January,” a dejected highlight on an otherwise frenetic album, stops in at one of life’s Sisyphean checkpoints: the hope of magically becoming a better person come New Year’s Day. “I made it through the year again with Diet Coke and cigarettes,” she sings. It could be any year; life, Barter seems to say, runs on a loop, and despite all we think we’ve learned, no amount of personal growth is certain to prevent mistakes. Even hindsight rarely makes everything clear. At least Hello, I’m Doing My Best makes it sound like a blast.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",,2019-10-28,7.2
Germs,(GI),"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","Trying to get the straight story of Los Angeles punk band Germs is like trying to piece together the timeline of a debaucherous night out: The specifics are blurry, the headache is blinding, and everybody has a different take on what happened. One lucid fact pierces through the hangover: Germs were a mess of contradictions. Doomed frontman Darby Crash was a well-read savant and a mumbling cretin, crowds adored and abhorred them, and the music they made in four belligerent years reached decades beyond their downfall. By the time their sole studio album (GI) arrived in 1979, Germs had swaggered their way to local infamy, and Crash had crowned himself the genius king of Hollywood’s juvenile delinquents. He died by suicide a little more than a year later at 22. The first LP ever released by Slash Records, (GI) captured Germs in top form. It documents four hardworking iconoclasts who somehow translated their chaotic live sets into a classic record.Before punk-rock brevity came into vogue, Germs opted for glam flamboyance: After forming in 1977, their working name was Sophistifuck and the Revlon Spam Queens. Crash (then known as Bobby Pyn) started the group with friend and classmate Pat Smear. Crash and Smear both attended IPS—an alternative education program within L.A.’s University High School that imparted principles of EST and Scientology. It was there that Crash first dabbled in amateur mind control. “[Darby] had this natural power,” Crash’s friend and schoolmate Paul Roessler recalled in the Germs oral history Lexicon Devil. “It was either that he was so much smarter than anybody else… or he had techniques that he learned from the books he read or from IPS. Or he just had magic.”It was this “magic” that somehow had Germs on everyone’s lips before their first gig at the Orpheum in ’77. Their live debut, opening for the Weirdos, included very little music. “Germs were absolutely fucking terrible!” recalled Weirdos drummer Nickey Beat. “They came on stage, tuned up for 10 or 15 minutes, and then got through maybe one-third of their first song and stopped and started over again… [Darby] took the mic and stuck it in a jar of peanut butter… The Germs weren’t to be taken seriously after that night… for a while.”What Germs lacked in serious prospects they made up for in absurdity. They taunted interviewers like bratty siblings, destroyed property, and got their first single, “Forming,” on the radio by calling KROQ DJ Rodney Bingenheimer multiple times a day until he relented. The band’s fuck-it-all approach seemed both carefree and calculated: long before merch bundles and lengthy album rollouts, Germs had T-shirts, a logo, and a loyal mob of fans, known as Circle One, before they ever laid down a record. Circle One members, typically women, identified themselves by wearing the band’s blue circle insignia, or with grisly “Germs Burns,” which were administered by searing the inner wrist with a lit cigarette from tip to filter. Once healed, a tidy, circular scar formed. “I completely control a number of people’s lives,” Crash once said. “Look around for the little girls wearing CRASH-TRASH T-shirts.” By late ’77, Germs were headlining Brendan Mullen’s notorious nightclub the Masque; punks queued out the door to watch Crash smash beer bottles and bleed on stage.Despite early lineup shuffles—their original drummer was future Go-Go Belinda Carlisle, who came down with mono and enlisted a friend to replace her before the band’s first gig—Germs’ circle wasn’t complete until percussionist Don Bolles joined Crash, guitarist Smear, and bassist Lorna Doom. Similarly, the boy born Jan Paul Beahm did not seal his fate until he rechristened himself Darby Crash. “Whereas Bobby Pyn seemed to me a much more innocent, goofy, carefree character,” Brendan Mullen wrote, “Darby Crash became much more demonic, complex, intense, intoxicated, as he gradually began to exude a much darker persona.”Prior to (GI) (short for “Germs Incognito”), the group had released only a couple of singles. Pronounced the “world’s most volatile band” by writer Kickboy Face, and the “worst band ever” by themselves, it seemed unlikely that any label would sign them. But Slash Records founder Bob Biggs was up to the task. He presented a contract, enlisted Joan Jett to produce, and fronted the cash for Quad Tech studios. Biggs later described his role in (GI) as more “glorified babysitter” than label maven.Something about their impending debut rearranged Germs’ molecular structure. Despite their prior shenanigans, Crash, Smear, Doom, and Bolles got their asses in gear. “My fondest memories of the Germs are right after the beginning and up to recording (GI)... which was a thrilling experience for me,” Doom said. The band rehearsed more than ever, putting in four hours a day, multiple times a week. Their work ethic in the studio was undisputed, although the same cannot be said for Jett, who was frequently passed out, according to many accounts (Crash even makes a crack about it in closing track “Shut Down”).Jett wasn’t the group’s first choice of producer—Crash had his heart set on Mark Lindsay of Paul Revere and the Raiders, but he was too expensive. Jett, who insists she only slept on the job one time, was chosen for her talent, proximity, and friendship with the band. Asleep or not, she managed to channel their focus. “Darby took it pretty seriously,” she said. “We didn’t have to do a lot of takes. He was certainly not out of control in the studio. He respected me. Did what I asked him to do… It was controlled nuttiness at that point.”(GI) was yet another page in Germs’ tome of contradictions. Suddenly, the peanut butter-smeared, tantrum-prone little freaks had (nearly) sobered up and delivered one of the most influential records in punk history. Darby Crash’s progression from blathering imbecile to secret rock’n’roll poet shocked everyone. X’s John Doe was particularly surprised by Crash’s vernacular: “You didn’t know the words because it was all like ‘Warrrrrrrrwarrrwarr,’ when Darby’d sing them live,” he said. “So everyone was just astounded when they got that first Slash record and actually read the lyrics. They were great!”(GI) is often considered the first-ever hardcore album. Bolles’ drumming style was fast and savage, doubling the BPMs of anything the Sex Pistols or Television had released. Meanwhile, Crash’s vocals were far removed from X’s harmonies and Joey Ramone’s chewed-up bubblegum. Crash didn’t sing: he growled. On (GI) centerpiece “Manimal,” he assumes the pelt of a rabid feline: “I came into this world like a puzzled panther/Waiting to be caged… I was never quite tamed,” he snarls. “Manimal” contains some of Crash’s most succinct and effective writing. It has none of the stilted, two-dollar words that sometimes appeared in Germs’ catalog (even Smear admitted that Crash’s lyrics could be “a bit pretentious”), and the song marries thematic and sonic elements better than most of their tracks. It is also one of many cuts on (GI) to hint at Crash’s impending death. “Evolution is a process/Too slow to save my soul,” he sneers, before letting out a pained roar like a wildcat being dragged off by poachers.Like many bands, Germs’ ingenuity grew from limitations. When they formed, no one could really play an instrument, save for Smear, who dabbled in guitar throughout high school. As they performed and rehearsed, they realized they could play better and faster. Bolles perfected his machine-gun drumming, Doom fine-tuned her trademark “wall-of-whump” basslines, and Smear developed a guitar style that was shrill, gritty, and metallic—it often sounded like he was scraping his strings with a cheese grater. Their playing on (GI) is a balancing act of personality and restraint, leaving space for Crash to run the show.Crash was a born prophet, a “premeditated would-be apocalyptic cult leader,” as friend and producer Geza X put it in another oral history, We Got the Neutron Bomb. Darby’s followers were already chauffeuring him around L.A. and footing his endless bar tab long before (GI) arrived. “When you have people for friends and they’re not the kind of people you want, what do you do?” he once asked an interviewer. “You make some better ones.” On (GI), Crash’s frightening magnetism was spelled out in song, and “We Must Bleed” is the most stirring distillation of his power. Crash repeats the titular line with such conviction, he sounds like a deranged preacher distributing the poisoned applesauce to his disciples.Crash was intrigued by the charisma of cult leaders and dictators, from Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard to Charles Manson, Hitler, and Mussolini. “Richie Dagger’s Crime” portrayed a more benevolent side of Darby’s coercive nature. The song’s narrator is a holdover from Crash’s glam roots—a swaggering “boy that nobody owns.” Dagger was a dead ringer for Crash, who grew from “a child despised” into a teenage messiah. When he sings, “I can take on your heroes” it’s both a threat and a premonition—and the closest Germs ever came to pop music. “Lexicon Devil,” perhaps (GI)’s most iconic entry, repurposes Crash’s favorite manipulation device, suffered by everyone he knew: “Gimme, gimme this, gimme, gimme thaaaaaaat.” The song was an admission of Crash’s thirst for supremacy, confirming that nothing he did was by accident.If any of (GI)’s songs were out of step with Germs’ repertoire, it was “Shut Down,” a nine-minute, narcotized jam session. Smear, Doom, and Bolles made minor detours from one circular riff, while Crash improvised lyrics that volleyed between playful and disturbing. One minute, he mocked Belinda Carlisle for being a cheerleader. Measures later, he nodded to the needle: “When I put that in my arm, I know that it done no harm.”(GI) came out at a time when Led Zeppelin, Supertramp, and the Eagles were topping the Billboard 200. It didn’t get anywhere near the charts, but local critics took note. In his Los Angeles Times column, Richard Meltzer crowned (GI) album of the year, calling it “the most remarkable L.A. studio achievement at least since L.A. Woman.” At last, there was documentation that Germs were a legitimate band who could write and cut a record, and a great record at that. It was their best work—the gold standard they never got the chance to improve upon.In the following year, Darby Crash rapidly eroded due to substance abuse. Filmmaker Penelope Spheeris’ punk documentary The Decline of Western Civilization captured his incoherence, making previous claims of his “genius” seem ridiculous. As Crash’s drug use escalated in his final months, so did his sense of alienation. Germs broke up, Crash made a failed attempt at going solo, and he became increasingly distraught over his closeted sexuality—many of Crash’s friends didn’t learn he was gay until after he died. On December 3, Germs played a reunion show. Everyone agreed it was the band’s best performance ever. Don Bolles was so happy playing the concert, he was convinced Germs would regroup for good. But Crash had other plans. “The only reason I’m doing this is to get money to get enough heroin to kill myself with,” he told Smear before the gig. Crash had threatened suicide so many times that few people took him seriously. Four nights later, Crash and friend Casey Cola procured $400 worth of heroin, drove to Cola’s mother’s house, and shot up. Somehow, Cola survived. When she came to the next day, Crash was lying dead next to her.In a cruel twist of fate, Darby Crash died a day before John Lennon, and the news of his passing was largely overshadowed by the Beatle’s murder. It took years for Crash to be widely recognized as a gifted writer, but his work took on a new life after his ended. Germs had an immediate impact on their L.A. peers, but their contributions were particularly felt in the following decades, when artists like Hole, L7, Melvins, Henry Rollins, Meat Puppets, and Red Hot Chili Peppers cited the band as a major influence. After a string of odd jobs and musical exploits, Smear joined Nirvana as a second guitarist in 1993. As a touring member for their In Utero trek, Smear played on the band’s famed MTV Unplugged session in 1994. Following Kurt Cobain’s death, Smear became a founding member of Foo Fighters. He still plays with them today.Bolles continues to perform with a handful of bands, and works as a radio DJ. Doom, who passed away earlier this year, retreated from the music scene after Crash died, remerging briefly in the early 2000s to play a few reunion gigs with Smear, Bolles, and actor Shane West filling in on vocals. West starred as Crash in the 2007 Germs biopic What We Do Is Secret, a heap of schmaltz that is hard to watch, but confirms the ill-fated frontman’s eternal allure. Darby Crash knew that Germs’ music was the first step in establishing his legacy. “Records are only a medium to get something else done,” he once said. “I want to die when I’m done.” (GI) serves as the final testament from one of punk’s most divisive figures—a man who was sadistic and kind, brilliant and obtuse, and destined to eclipse his inner circle.",,2019-10-27,9.0
Jonathan Fire*Eater,Tremble Under Boom Lights,,"Jonathan Fire*Eater’s Walter Martin once interrupted a meeting with Dreamworks label brass to see about capping sales of Wolf Songs for Lambs, their major label debut, at an even half-million, lest the band grew too big, too quickly. Ambitious, but perhaps a bit premature; Wolf Songs wound up selling about 10,000 copies in the early going, a few zeros shy of the Appetite for Destruction numbers Martin was gunning for. Chutzpah isn’t everything, but it’s certainly not nothing, and what DC-to-NYC before-their-timers Jonathan Fire*Eater lacked in bankable success, they more than made up with unshakable faith in their own abilities. Through their brief, tumultuous tenure, the elegantly wasted JFE looked, acted, and frequently even sounded like heirs apparent to the big crown. They never really came close.Yet, while traditional markers of fame and fortune may’ve eluded them, Jonathan Fire*Eater’s influence on a generation of stall-hogging, scene-making New York rockers—some of whom did go on to the kind world-conquering fame JFE only grasped at—is incalculable. Flip through the first few chapters of Lizzy Goodman’s NYC scene tell-all Meet Me in the Bathroom, and you’ll see one bold-face name after another singing JFE’s praises, if not openly copping to stealing their moves. Jonathan*Fire Eater were it; and then, just as suddenly, they weren’t.For years now, Jonathan Fire*Eater have been a band more talked about than actually listened to. That’s largely been a problem of access: For nearly 20 years, just about the only record available through the usual channels was the spiny Wolf Songs for Lambs, which served as many curious Karen O fans’ first and only taste of JFE. And Wolf Songs is a stellar record, all subterranean scrum atop squealing organs and clattering drums. Now, Third Man has brought Tremble Under Boom Lights—the band’s 1996 mini-LP, released a year before Wolf Songs—back to shelves, alongside five bonus cuts and a chapbook of Stewart Lupton’s poetry. It’s not quite Marvin Berry holding the receiver up to Marty McFly, but two decades on, Tremble Under Boom Lights does manage to sound like a hiccup in the timeline: The brash young JFE didn’t just arrive in NYC fully formed, they showed up to the party five years early.The short version of Jonathan Fire*Eater’s turgid tale goes something like this: DC boys, prep schoolers all, forge a proto-JFE called the Ignobles. The Ignobles eventually relocate to NYC, recruit bassist Tom Frank, put Stewart Lupton behind the mic, and acquire the asterisk. From there, they hustled: Meet Me in the Bathroom finds Lupton glad-handing at every gallery opening and 4 a.m. bar he could find, shamelessly trying to get the word out. Even early on, JFE had something: They were preppy with an unlikely goth edge, “talky” without digressing into polemic, wide-ranging in their musical interests but still very much rooted in oily, scuzzy rock’n’roll. Once they’d worked through the collective throat-clearing of their self-titled debut, their sound was fully in place: big blasts of Walter Martin’s dusty organ, Matt Barrick’s galvanic drumwork, Frank’s subcutaneous bass, Paul Maroon’s alternately stately and spooky guitar, and the scrawled-past-the-margins picaresques of the late Stewart Lupton.Lupton was possessed with the kind of preternatural confidence granted to only the heavily deluded and the genuinely dazzling, and after three seconds with Tremble Under Boom Lights, it’s pretty clear he wasn’t kidding himself. He’s a man of 1,000 voices, able to jut nimbly through a dry Iggy Pop drawl, a squawking Timmy Taylor falsetto, and the Jarvis-worthy swoon that closes out “Winston Plum: Undertaker.” Mostly, though, he’s a scene-stealer, a scenery chewer: whether prattling on about yet another estranged relative or passing out in the hotel hallway after too much free record company hooch, Lupton’s never less than compelling, stuffing scene after roundabout scene with past regrets and unsteady futures.Rollicking highlight “Give Me Daughters” imagines Lupton, years down the road, ringing up his theoretical offspring from some dingy motel. The song is more or less a tacit admission that Lupton’s not about to settle down anytime soon, and like many of his songs, it finds him sliding further and further into a kind of perpetual transience: always on the go, always looking for a new rush, always wondering what his life might’ve been had he hewed a little closer to the straight and narrow. Lupton’s prone to abstraction and red herrings, stocking the pond with characters whose purpose remains somewhat unclear. This Dylanesque combination of cracked imagery cut with bohemian drift is the jewel in Lupton’s crown, the dividing line between JFE and so many other citified mopesters, past and present. “It’s important that you know how I want all the shadows on my street to converge every time it snows and have the conversation that they really need,” he sings on the gnashing “Make It Precious,” the kind of line—and there are plenty like it here—you could spend a lifetime turning over in your head.The tension between the wild-eyed, increasingly unpredictable Lupton and his more temperate bandmates was JFE’s ultimate undoing, but Tremble finds the two sides sparking each other to new heights. Tom Frank—along with Lupton, JFE’s only non-Walkman—brings an almost visceral heft to the low end with his near-toneless bass. Matt Barrick’s drumwork is, as with the Walkmen, the electricity in the socket: without him, the whole thing never gets off the ground. On the organ, Walter Martin favors a piercing, otherworldly sound that’s more “96 Tears” than the grandiose Rothko techtonics he favored later. They wield this rangy, malleable sound—an ever-shifting mishmash of moddish classic rock and post-punk, speckled with Motown and new romance—with all the foolish audacity of youth. These guys just went for it, and 20 years past its sell-by date, their cocktail of inexperience and gall hasn’t lost a drop of potency.The five songs from the initial Tremble release are joined here by five additional tunes: three from 1995’s Public Hanging of a Movie Star EP, a pants-free cover of Lee Hazlewood’s “The City Never Sleeps,” and the previously unheard “In the Head.” The spry, mercurial Tremble songs, available for the first time this century, are the real draw here, but the Public Hanging songs—JFE’s first release after their forgettable debut—are where the band sorted out the sonics, pushed the vocals to the front, and came into their own. “In the Head” is thought to be their final recording, finished not long before their 1998 split; it’s tempting to hear the first murmurs of the Walkmen in its “In the New Year” ripple, but the tune belongs, as they all do, to Lupton: Adopting a decidedly Dylanesque wheeze, he inches the ambling track heavenward. By the end, organs are churning, Lupton’s howling, and the whole thing seems to collapse in on itself. Lupton seems right at home.Influence is a strange currency: It seems valuable enough, but the exchange rate’s lousy. Jonathan Fire*Eater were, for a moment, the hottest band in New York, which was just enough to earn them a massively lopsided deal with Dreamworks and the occasional Paul Banks namecheck. Their stormy, searching sound still looms large over the glammy inversions of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, the brackish urgency of Interpol, and so many others, but for too long, that’s how most people encountered their music: indirectly. Once JFE split, Lupton disappeared for a couple years, reemerging as the Childballads and, later, the Beatin’s; Martin, Barrick, and Maroon’s Walkmen called it quits in late 2013, and Frank took a gig with Vanity Fair. Lupton passed away in 2018, a tragically early end. There’ll always be a lot of “what if?” hanging over JFE, particularly now, with no chance of a full reunion. But for all their accidents of fate, Jonathan*Fire Eater accomplished something most bands can only dream of: not many may remember, but those who do won’t soon forget.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",,2019-10-26,8.0
Jimmy Eat World,Surviving,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=rock"">Rock</a>","Surviving is apt. Formed in 1993, and featuring the same core members since ’95, Jimmy Eat World has enjoyed a course marked by steady output, frequent touring and quiet durability. As luck would have it, they’ve hung on long enough to find themselves releasing their 10th studio album just as emo nostalgia reaches its zenith. Surviving is both occasion for a survey of the beloved Arizona band’s two-decade-plus career and a further push into arena rock; a driving, if not always transportative, selection that should tour favorably.Their latest reunites them with Justin Meldal-Johnsen, the producer for M83 and decades-long live bassist for Beck who worked on their triumphant last album, 2016’s Integrity Blues. On Surviving, the producer guides the band’s instincts towards a heavier sound, letting noise from their guitars and Zach Lind’s drums decay. Meldal-Johnsen addresses lacunae in frontman Jim Adkins’ operative knowledge of synth sounds, as on the U2-evocative “555,” an album outlier which features some Fitz and the Tantrums-like hand-clapping. James King, co-founding member of Fitz, shows up for a saxophone solo on “All The Way (Stay),” just like he did on the Meldal-Johnsen-produced M83 sparkler “Midnight City.” Longtime collaborator and former touring member Rachel Haden, of that dog., contributes backing vocals. The track, which considers staying away from the party rather than at it (“Who really says they hope they’ll meet ‘the one’ for the first time at a bar drinking early?”) is one of the more personal allusions to recovery from addiction that Adkins, sober for six years, ventures here.Lyrically, Surviving is as sincere as their past efforts but less specific. “You’re not alone in pain/Never alone in pain,” Adkins sings on the album’s title track. The band’s shortest LP to date, Surviving moves at a quick clip, losing some of the polish from their last outing with Meldal-Johnsen. They’re conscious when they sound too slick for their own good: The opening acoustic guitar riff on “One Mil” was recorded on Adkins’ iPhone mic in his garage. AFI frontman Davey Havok, who appears on the album finale “Congratulations,” also appears via iPhone.“There’s no clarity in front of me,” Adkins sings on that song, which serves as a sort of curtain call. At six minutes, it somehow still feels a little short. It’s hard to imagine this iteration of J.E.W. recording another “Goodbye Sky Harbor,” that loitering Clarity closer that would take up nearly half of their latest album’s length. By Surviving’s terminus, listeners might find themselves wanting more risks. But the album on the whole is a solid, self-aware addition to Jimmy Eat World’s catalog, and if the band’s modest strivers’ outlook has proved anything, it’s that there will be another. A band whose biggest song is against writing oneself off always has work to do.Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)","[Verse 1]
Don't hide your face
What you were before
Doesn't have to be
You any more
Maybe you've been scared
And that's what you know
And all the shame
Gonna call you home
It's gonna call you home

[Verse 2]
It never was your fault
But still a part you played
You carry it so close
You can read it's name
In a lot of ways
You're still that lost kid
Yeah, you could still survive
But not exactly live
No, not exactly live

[Verse 3]
Gonna stand this cold
Gonna see it out
Never define yourself
What choice is left there to make?
If no one said it yet
It would be a shame
It ends right now
You never wanted the pain
Never wanted the pain

[Outro]
Never wanted the pain
Never wanted the pain
Never wanted the pain[Verse 1]
The ghost of recent misery
Still has a song to sing
You captivated hearts
Waiting for a spark
No one you care to recognize
Suddenly in control
Unfortunate to find
What it is inside

[Chorus]
Criminal energy
If you got blood to bleed
Your fever with the fight
Your each and every night
Oh, yeah, you'll come to see
We're the same, we're the same, yeah, it's understood
We're gonna take, gonna take while the getting's good
Come get it all for free
Criminal energy, criminal energy
Huh

[Verse 2]
Answer any conspiracy
So irresistible
But there's no them to see
Only you and me
No face, no cause for empathy
They tell you all the time
The threat is still alive
Yeah, that's still a lie

Criminal energy
If you got blood to bleed
Your fever with the fight

Well, I know I'm dreaming
But it feels too good to stop
The picture in my head is always moving
We're alone at sunset
There's snowfall in air
It's only special once 'cause there's an ending

[Pre-Chorus]
And we realize we're in a future memory

[Chorus]
I can only use what I learn from you
And the rest I quietly accept and burn through
I can only be so much potentially
From the rest, I patiently request delivery

[Verse 2]
Don't worry where we end up
This ending up's not real
The life we build we never stop creating
So we move to a cliffside
A shoreline nowhere
A freezing drive ahead with every crossing

[Pre-Chorus]
And the things you hope someday will come keep waiting

[Chorus]
I can only use what I learn from you
And the rest I quietly accept and burn through
I can only be so much potentially
From the rest, I patiently request delivery

[Bridge]
Sold on a lie
A lie old as time
You'll search until you die
Only partially the truth
Someone's out there for you
But not everyone's ready to be found
No, you might not be ready to be found

[Chorus]
I can only use what I learned from you
And the rest I quietly accept and burn through
I can only be so much potentially
From the rest, I patiently request delivery
I can only use what I learn from you
And the rest I quietly accept and burn through
I can only be so much potentially
From the rest, I patiently request delivery[Verse 1]
I keep my focus on the simple things
Trying to find some peace along the way
Wish I knew how long I'm supposed to wait
Holding on but just barely

[Pre-Chorus]
Got the feeling I've been talking to a dead, dead line
There's always a reason to let it change
Is there anyone there listening while you cry, cry, cry?
There's always a reason for the pain

[Chorus]
I'm doing the things that I'm told every day, every day, every day
Then why does it feel like I'm moving in place, in place, in place?

[Verse 2]
Never had anything to prove
But never was anyone like you
All you fought through, all you had to face
Made you stronger, unafraid

[Pre-Chorus]
Got the feeling I've been talking to a dead, dead line
There's always a reason to let it change
Is there anyone there listening while you cry, cry, cry?
Always a reason for the pain

[Chorus]
I'm doing the things that I'm told every day, every day, every day
Then why does it feel like I'm moving in place, in place, in place?
I gotta believe that you're there when I sing, when I sing, when I sing
'Cause if you're not real, I'm losing my head, in my head, in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
Got the feeling I've been talking to a dead, dead line
There's always a reason to let it change
Is there anyone there listening while you cry, cry, cry?
Always a reason for the pain

[Chorus]
I'm doing the things I've been told every day, every day, every day
Then why does it feel like I'm moving in place, in place, in place?
I gotta believe that you're there when I sing, when I sing, when I sing
'Cause if you're not real, I'm losing my head, in my head, in my head

[Outro]
I keep my focus on the simple things
Trying to find some peace along the way[Verse 1]
Camera girl, you still there?
If I look you'll disappear
Worse, you might wanna talk
I'm so underprepared
I don't know, is it real?
I can't ignore the way it feels
Like the stomach punch it is

[Chorus]
I try but I can waste one million chances
Before you're gone, before I get your name
Keep dreamin' 'cause I'm the only one awake here
You're always gone, always slip away

[Verse 2]
Can't explain why it sticks
Why I seem to get stuck in
Unsustainable amounts of time reliving this
I wish I had mastery of wit, luck, fearless confidence
And shred majestically to your heart

[Chorus]
I try but I can waste one million chances
Before you're gone, before I get your name
Keep dreamin' 'cause I'm the only one awake here
You're always gone, always slip away

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I try but I can waste one million chances
Before you're gone, before I get your name
Keep dreamin' 'cause I'm the only one awake here
You're always gone, always slip away
I try but I can waste one million chances
Before you're gone, before I get your name
Keep dreamin' 'cause I'm the only one awake here
You're always gone, always slip away[Verse 1]
Going out we hope to lose ourselves
Then get found in unlikely places
A little presumption's all you need
To end up empty
Who really says they hope they'll meet the one
For the first time at a bar drinking early?
Easy enough to say ""Hey man, I'm done""
And never hear them say

[Chorus]
Oh honey, if you stay, hey, hey
We go all the way
But how am I supposed to know, oh, no
When to let the feelings show?
Honey, if you stay, hey, hey
We take it all the way
And no one really knows, oh, no
When to let the feelings show, oh-ho, oh-ho
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
We get discouraged by the pointlessness
And we're pretty quick to judge things pointless
There's what I want and what I need
And the latter takes a while to see
It doesn't matter how often or how old
It starts with an awkward beginning
I believe that what I've learned has worth
And what I choose to do means something

[Chorus]
So honey, if you stay, hey, hey
We go all the way
But how am I supposed to know, oh, no
When to let the feelings show?
Honey, if you stay, hey, hey
We take it all the way
'Cause no one really knows, oh, no
When to let the feelings show, oh-ho, oh-ho

[Bridge]
Crowds and the noise receding
Down to just you and me, yeah
We could do anything you want

[Chorus]
So honey, if you stay, hey, hey
We go all the way
But how am I supposed to know, oh, no
When to let the feelings show?
Honey, if you stay, hey, hey
We take it all the way
Whoever really knows, oh, no
When to let the feelings show? Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

[Outro]
When to let the feelings show, oh-oh, oh-oh
When to let the feelings show, oh-oh, oh-oh
When to let the feelings show, oh-oh, oh-oh
When to let the feelings show, oh-oh, oh-oh
When to let the feelings show, oh-oh, oh-oh
When to let the feelings show, oh-oh, oh-oh[Verse 1]
When I find myself awake
I'll put my thoughts down on the page
Half-asleep, I'll make a list
Then read back all my greatest hits
Should meditate, should work out more
Should read until my brain gets sore
Meet someone, go far away
Try being socially less strange

[Chorus]
That's how a diamond grows, yeah
Give yourself the right chance over time
Don't believe them if they try to sell you something quicker, yeah

[Verse 2]
I cut at least half of my friends
But no one noticed or mentioned
I thought at last I'd breathe easy
But then I thought a lot of things
Hey new year, hey new you
You left so much low-hanging fruit
You're in the ring for the title fight
With only montage training time

[Chorus]
That's how a diamond grows, yeah
Give yourself the right chance over time
Don't believe them if they try to sell you something quicker, yeah
That's how a diamond grows, yeah
Reach as far as you can then hold tight
Don't believe them if they try to tell you something different, yeah

[Bridge]
They say a diamond grows with time
I believe it, 'cause I've seen it with my eyes
Well, there's a guaranteed parade of broken promises
Did you expect some kind of miracle
You do what you can do, that's all, all, all

[Chorus]
That's how a diamond grows, yeah
Give yourself the right chance over time
Don't believe them if they try to sell you something quicker, yeah
That's how a diamond grows with time
Don't believe them if they try to tell you something different[Verse 1]
Love ain't never been your friend
Love never gonna hear what you're demanding
Love ain't some magical thing
Love never gonna be the way you're dreaming

[Chorus]
It's gonna seem so far
It's gonna feel so hard
Until you want the work more than the reward
Do you want the work more than the reward?

[Verse 2]
Love ain't some magical thing
Love never gonna be the way you're dreaming

[Chorus]
It's gonna seem so far
It's gonna feel so hard
Until you want the work more than the reward
Until you stop asking ""Oh, what is it all for?""
Do you want the work more than the reward?

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
It's gonna seem so far
It's gonna feel so hard
Until you want the work more than the reward
Until you stop asking ""Oh, what is it all for?""
Do you want the work more than the reward?[Verse 1]
Will they tell you what you missed?
All you have traded in
And it hits
You're not that different
The truth is no one did
Half of it

[Chorus]
Think all this time what you're giving
Stay in my heart or waste another life
Start another life

[Verse 2]
From a fever to a kiss
Such frivolousness
They exist
It's all significant
No one straight line to live
Recommit

[Chorus]
Think all this time what you're giving
Stay in my heart or waste another life
Start another life
Think all this time what you're giving
Stay in my heart or waste another life
Start another life

[Bridge]
Always commanding
A way out
Is coming

[Chorus]
Think all this time what you're giving
Stay in my heart or waste another life
Start another life
Think all this time what you're giving
Stay in my heart or waste another life
Start another life

[Outro]
Or waste another life
Start another life[Verse 1]
There's no clarity in front of me
Only degrees of hating
Obscenity, there's no charity
Some don't deserve to make it
You'll blame and fight each other
For just a slice of plunder

Whose foot you're crawling under

Ah-ah, oh-oh-oh (Ah-ah, oh-oh-oh)
You're on your own

Read carefully, can't possibly
A threat to future earnings
Suspiciously, through editing
The facts are disappearing
With discipline and message
You'll take awkward possession
Of nothing you really wanted
Welcome, congratulations

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, you're on
You're on your own

[Verse 3]
There's no clarity in front me
Only degrees of hating
Obscenity, there's no charity

Eartheater,Trinity,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=experimental"">Experimental</a>","Alexandra Drewchin titled the fourth full-length release under her Eartheater alias as a nod to the three states matter can commonly take: solid, liquid, and gas. It’s a fitting conceit to drape over her work, which tends to melt from concrete pop forms into ominous miasma and back again. Trinity, a mixtape made in collaboration with half a dozen New York producers including AceMo and Tony Seltzer, crystallizes Drewchin’s experimental slant into a full set of dance music built around her signature oblique vocals. Without sacrificing Eartheater’s compelling strangeness, Drewchin has assembled the project’s most accessible and triumphant offering to date.Dance beats skittered here and there on past Eartheater records, but more often than not they worked as texturing tools against the rest of Drewchin’s nebulous compositions. On “Curtains,” from 2018’s IRISIRI, a rave beat pulsed against sheets of placid harp, as though leaking into an orchestral musician’s practice session from an upstairs apartment. Trinity hews closer to the traditional dynamics of dance music: Its songs take beats for their backbones, even if those beats often lurch uneasily through dizzying arrangements. For every element on Trinity that’s easy to grasp, another repels and confuses the ear. On “High Tide” and “Supersoaker,” glassy synthesizer riffs echo late-’90s radio trance, while the blunt bass drums on “Pearl Diver” recall avant-garde strains of contemporary hip-hop.Throughout the record, Drewchin’s voice closes off the easy access points of dance pop, which in its most mainstream incarnations tends to flood listeners with dopamine at every chorus. Layered and thinned with reverb, her singing remains slippery, her lyrics often tricky to pin down. Ostensibly these are love songs, and yet their streaks of affection drip out in confusing, contradictory ways, in double negatives and barely intelligible whispers. “I don’t wanna regret/Something I didn’t do/With you,” Drewchin sings on “Runoff”—a statement that starts out with what sounds like hesitation, which turns into abandon by the end of the sentence.Because her presence is often elusive, it tends to beckon the ear to sink deeper into each song, to grasp at a salient phrase or an especially tuneful melody. Drewchin makes it easy to get lost in her ambiguous sound worlds, which don’t seem to have clear boundaries but always appear to be deepening in volume.Trinity’s tensions build toward its final song and thesis statement, “Solid Liquid Gas.” Rather than end the record on an uncertain, sour note, Drewchin and producer Hara Kiri give it the sendoff it deserves—an unleashed, cathartic dance track where Drewchin’s voice clears away the mist that had clung to it. “Don’t make me wait!” she demands, her voice dense and sharp over a frothing synthesizer arpeggio. If latent desire percolates throughout Trinity, voiced in hushed tones, then “Solid Liquid Gas” gives Drewchin the chance to finally let her wanting rush out of her. It’s a blissful release that bursts past the cerebral parameters of her prior work and into new territory—the kind of song that jolts through the whole body, thrilling as it goes.","I can see you

Rex Orange County,Pony,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=pop"">Pop/R&amp;B</a>","Alex O’Connor self-released bcos u will never b free, his first modest bedroom project as Rex Orange County, in 2015. It’s not hard to hear the appeal of that first tape: The songs were imperfect and angsty, with an amateur production style that fit Rex’s creaky nasal voice. “Pizza box/Wedding ring left amongst the crust,” he drawled, sketching a banal, absurd image of a crumbling relationship. “Don’t miss me when I’m dead,” he pleaded, and then followed up with an earnest rap verse about rejecting peer pressure.His sound also appealed to Tyler, the Creator, who recruited the English singer and songwriter for his 2017 album Flower Boy. It became Rex’s breakout moment. After meeting Tyler, he rushed out another album, Apricot Princess, so that people who learned about him from Flower Boy would have something to listen to. This week, he released Pony, his first album for Sony and the third entry in Rex’s slim, sentimental catalog.Rex’s distinctive voice has earned him the epithet “old soul,” but his newest music is relentlessly juvenile. When he landed a Spotify deal that offered the opportunity to work with an established artist on a cover song, he picked Randy Newman and “You’ve Got a Friend in Me.” On Pony, a collection of 10 new songs irritating enough to activate the mildest allergy to sincerity, he sings about being young and in love; about getting a little older but not yet old enough; about feeling like a comic-book superhero and getting “Stressed Out.” “When we have to speak I usually shoe gaze,” he admits on “Laser Lights,” with a delivery style equally indebted to Chance the Rapper’s singing and Ed Sheeran’s rapping.Pony employs a more childlike musical palette than Rex’s earlier projects—bubbly synths, electric piano, programmed beats, bells, strings, and bird chirps—and though there’s still a waxy haze surrounding them, the intensity is dialed up. There’s always something jumping out of the mix to compete for attention—sometimes a pop of cartoonish horns, but more often Rex’s quavery voice, a limiting factor Pony tries every possible way to work around: chipmunk squeaks (“Stressed Out”), Vocoder (“Never Had the Balls”), digital barbershop quartet (“Face to Face”), distant-sounding piped-in vocals set to strings (“Pluto Projector”) or a disco beat (“It Gets Better”). The lyrics to “Never Had the Balls” feel extra crude because the setting is so immature; the treacly piano love song “Every Way” would be more believable from Mr. Rogers.None of this straining supports an interesting idea. “Four years later/Look where we really are/Look how far we’ve come,” Rex sings on “It Gets Better,” over tinny, melodramatic electric strings. He’s not talking about graduating, or growing up in general—he’s talking about a girl who’s transformed his world in ways apparently not worth itemizing. You won’t find a wedding ring in a pizza box here. The album’s most salient detail is when Rex recalls a particular house where he once vomited.Pony’s best line comes at the opening of “Pluto Projector,” a slow, Frank Ocean-esque ballad. “The great protector/Is that what I’m supposed to be?” Rex asks. “What if all this counts for nothin’/Everything I thought I’d be?/What if by the time I realize/It’s too far behind to see?” Toward the end, the song takes a weird turn: a pitched-down vocal coda that makes Rex sound like he’s drop-shipping counterfeit “Nikes.”But Rex Orange County isn’t Frank Ocean; he stacks vast emotional weight on predictable, inoffensive songs until they buckle like wire shelving. Pony is simplistic, clueless, subtlety-free. “Didn’t understand until the age of 18/Even then I was blind,” he sings on “It Gets Better.” Over and over again, Rex sounds like he hasn’t begun to realize how much he doesn’t know.","[Verse 1]
I had to think about my oldest friends
Now, I no longer hang with them
And I can't wait to be home again
I had a year that nearly sent me off the edge
I feel like a five, I can't pretend
But if I get my shit together this year
Maybe I'll be a ten

[Pre-Chorus]
Help myself a little better
'Cause it's getting tirin'
And I can't wait for the summer
Now, I'm gonna need a moment

[Chorus]
I did it again, I did it again
No control over my emotions
One year on and I still can't focus
I did it again, yeah
I did it, I did it again
Twelve rounds in, fightin' solo
But nobody wins when it ends

[Verse 2]
We'll be placin' memories in frames
Invitin' people 'round to stay
And always owning up to things, to things
'Cause, after all, I guess it all depends upon
The people you choose and where you're from
If so, I've been so lucky, so far, it's outrageous
I won't complain (No)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll give myself a little credit
Since I dealt with all the pain
Yeah, I turned superhero
I'm comin' in Bruce Wayne

[Chorus]
Yeah, I did it again, I did it again
But this time I took control
And turned my shit 'round
Sometimes you gotta cut a bitch out
I'm livin' again, yeah
I'm livin', I'm livin' again
(Yeah-ah, woah, yeah)

[Bridge]
Na na-na-na na, na, na, na
Na na-na, na, na-na, na, na
Na-na, na-na-na-na, na, na-na-na, na

[Outro]
Now, I'm safe and sound where I belong
It took all my strength to carry on
And though it's still hard work to find the words
I'm still gonna write this fuckin' song
'Cause, after all, I guess it all depends upon
The people you choose and where you're from[Intro]
Ahh!

[Refrain]
Ooh-ooh, ooh (Yeah)
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
It’s hard to make yourself believe
That it’ll get better when you feel defeated
And carrying on is easier said than done
It took a while to see that I was in need
Of help from somebody else but she keeps
Reminding me that I’m not the only one

[Pre-Chorus]
And babe, I woulda told you this was gonna happen
If I had known that it would
But now there’s less time and more things that I need to say
And I’m afraid

[Chorus]
That there will always be a part of me that’s holding on
And still believes that everything is fine
And that I’m living a normal life
But until somebody sits me down
And tells me that I’m different now
I’ll always be the way I always am
Oh, oh

[Refrain]
Ooh-ooh, ooh (Yeah)
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
My apologies, it’s such a shame
I never planned to feel this way
But the more that I try, the more I’m seeing a difference
I’m not gonna lie

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I get to sit down
And I’m happy to admit now, I’m on my way
It seems I’m not invincible
But I’m bored of the pain and I need to explain

[Chorus]
Yeah, there will always be a part of me that’s holding on
And still believes that everything is fine
And that I’m living a normal life
But until somebody sits me down
And tells me why I’m different now
I’ll always be the way I always am
Yeah, yeah

[Outro]
I, I
Woo[Verse 1]
I might eat breakfast here before I move on
Laser lights all around me when I get the chance
To get my groove on
Dancing by myself, I still take my shoes off
And ignore it 'til I feel alright
And I might get restless if I stay for too long
I would up and leave this fuckin' bullshit
If it meant that I could see her
Dancing to the shit that sounds nothing like me, huh?
Dancing to the shit I like

[Verse 2]
But now I'm losing my speed
Because I'm not the type of person who can handle defeat
And I'll be caught up and confused about what matters to me
Still in the same position same time next week
I'll be losing my speed, for sure
But I don't like it anymore, nah
Losing my, losing my

[Verse 3]
Palm to the face, when we have to speak I usually shoegaze
And if I saw you in public, I would pretend to tie my shoelace
Just so we avoid the, ""What's up-up-up?""
You'll never love me like they do, you'll never love me like she does
You, I could never commit to, I'm too fond of my own freedom
I know you're all about the checks, but boy, I don't need 'em
I think I'll get that myself
Thank you anyway (Ah)
Said, ""I'm losing my, losing my speed""[Intro]
I grew up, you grew down, we found out
Everything matters now (Everything)
We grew up while you let yourself down
I want out

[Verse 1]
She calmed me down that night I freaked out
We stayed up, I threw up in that house
She woke up face-to-face from the bed
Two in the en-suite, one in the early
She was like eight hours ahead
Two different countries, slept in a one-piece
Baby boy in full effect
And you couldn't see me, call back, repeat
That's all thanks to poor connection
Fun for me, no
Most time, it's a pain in the neck
I said it's not that fun, see
Everything makes me wanna quit while I'm ahead
Honestly

[Chorus]
She wakes, we face-to-face from the bed
I wish I could be with her instead
When we speak face-to-face from the head
Things go wayward and I end up upset, but

[Post-Chorus]
Never had done
No, I never had
Ooh

[Verse 2]
Maybe we grew outward (Yeah)
It's true, I kept the truth to myself
Now I'm nothing but a coward (Cow-)
And you were too busy making friends
You were occupied, I was in the shower
You were unaware, I was fully clothed
And you didn't know about this
But you wouldn't even really need to know
So continue picking flowers (Mm)
Remember why you're here, my friend
You can sit back and relax
And they'll always love you now and then
They'll always love you now and then
Always love you now and then
They'll always love you
It's true

[Chorus]
She wakes, we face-to-face from the bed
I wish I could be with her instead
When we speak face-to-face from the head
Things go wayward and I end up upset

[Post-Chorus]
Let me be over there again
I wish I could be with her instead
Let me return for the night shift
I miss her like she's my only friend

[Bridge]
My only friend, 100%
I unplugged, then I dipped on my friends
My world got so much smaller this year
Tell me 'bout it

[Chorus]
She wakes, we face-to-face from her bed
Instead, instead, yeah
When we speak face-to-face from the head
From the head, yeah, yeah
She wakes, we face-to-face from the bed
I wish I could be with her instead
When we speak face-to-face from the head
Things go wayward and I end up upset

[Post-Chorus]
Let me be over there again
I wish I could be with her instead
Let me return for the night shift
I miss her like she's my only friend

[Outro]
I grew up, you grew down, we found out
Everything matters now
We grew up while you let yourself down
I want out[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
They wanna take what's yours
They wanna go for dinner on your name
I let them take control and take me for a fool
It's such a shame
I never said a word and all the time that I waited was a waste
They wanna see me stressed out every day, I know it
They wanna lie and still be friends
But when you're at your worst, they're not there
And you discovered that they don't care

[Chorus]
So, you didn't know any better
Doesn't it feel unfair?
Doesn't it?
Doesn't it?
Doesn't it?

[Verse 2]
(Hey)
They wanna see me stressed out every day, I know it (Yeah)
They wanna lie and still be friends
But when you're at your worst, they're not there
And you discovered that they don't care

[Chorus]
So, you didn't know any better (Oh, you wanna see how?)
Doesn't it feel unfair? (Only wanna check on me now)
Yeah, yeah

[Outro]
(Oh, you wanna see how?
Only wanna check on me now
Oh, you wanna see how?
Only wanna check on me now)[Verse 1]
I was lost, felt nothing at all but
I'm coming back now, yeah, I'm in the background
No need to react now that everything's done (But let me say)
I thought it would be simple enough
And I had to grow up
Just to learn all the ways that it's not
But I never thought that I'd wanna call it quits in my whole life
I never aimed to feel confused, I blame myself to tell the truth
But now I know that everything's hard when you're living in the dark
And you don't even wanna see it through
If that had to be the way I'd be feeling for days
And I knew it back then, I probably wouldn't do it

[Chorus]
But I never got the chance to tell you
I never had the balls to tell you
No, I never had the balls to tell you

[Verse 2]
I did everything that I could, but still, I was helpless (So helpless)
I shouldn't waste my precious time
On anybody living off of mine
And now I know that things are getting better
I could live like this forever
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
When I found my own way out
Was to open my mouth and be honest
I had to go and do it, yeah

[Bridge]
""This could be the best decision that you ever make
Please, don't be afraid"", she reassures me
I know it's hard to play pretend
I promise you it's due to end
And winners never quit, you know, so quitters never win
(It's only getting better now for you)

[Verse 3]
I'm your man if you're looking for good times
Feel amazing and I'm on my way home
Yeah, I'm finally in the zone
I heard the word ""goodbye"" and felt surprised
That I wasn't even sad in the slightest
My mind was made up, but if I had to live a life
Only being polite, I'd be giving in
I'm never gonna do it

[Chorus]
I never got the chance to tell you
I never had the balls to tell you
No, I never had the balls to tell you now

[Outro]
Balls to tell you
Balls to tell you
I never got the chance to tell you (No)
Never had the balls to tell you
Balls to tell you
But I never got the chance to tell you (No)
Never had the balls to tell you (I didn't)
Balls to tell you[Verse 1]
The great protector
Is that what I'm supposed to be?
What if all this counts for nothing
Everything I thought I'd be?
What if by the time I realize
It's too far behind to see?
Seventy-mil projector
I can show you everything, yeah
And we're on our way to glory
Where the show won't ever end
And the encore lasts forever
And it's time we're due to spend

[Verse 2]
Spending the years together
Growing older every day (Every day)
I feel at home when I'm around you
And I'll gladly say again
I hope the encore lasts forever
Now there's time for us to spend
And it's sublime with you, my friend
This right here still feels like a honeymoon
When you say my name, nothing's changed
I'm still a boy inside my thoughts
Am I meant to understand my faults?

[Chorus]
I don't think so
I don't think I'm meant to understand myself
Maybe you do
And that's good for you
Maybe in time
Maybe one day
I'll do the same
(I'll do the same
I'll do the same
I'll do the same)

[Bridge]
I'll do the same as you
I'll try and hold it up
Soon I hope
Or as soon as I'm old enough
(Old enough to understand
Old enough to understand)

[Outro]
Stay forever, you know more than anyone (Yeah, whoa)
And it's you that knows my darkness
And you know my bedroom needs
You could blast me and my secrets
But there's probably just no need[Verse]
I care about you, in every way I can
You know I'm troubled, but I know you can understand
I'm sorry for the strain
No one prepares you for the way in which things change
But you've been amazing, saw me through my darkest stage
And you always forgave me
And now you love me just the same

[Chorus]
It means the most, I hope you know
And I hope you know
That I think about you in every single way

[Outro]
You're more familiar to me, more and more each day
I cry in front of you, and it's very necessary, babe
I will care about you, in every way I can[Verse 1]
Looking back, I guess that ignorance was a breeze
I thought I knew everything but I was naive
Didn't understand until the age of 18
Yeah, even then I was blind
2012, I remember being in need
True, 2015, you were fallin' for me
You sent through a love letter for me to read
And it's engraved in my mind

[Chorus]
She changed the world I know
And it's better for it
Four years later, and look where we really are
Look how far we've come
Look at us now

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, we're flying, I finally know I'm here for a reason
Thank you for waiting on me
I'm dying to see her, she's my favourite ever season
Thank you for everything

[Verse 2]
January, baby, I was takin' my time
Spending summer and then we'll be good in July
Why can't it be like this for the rest of my life?
Huh, no, I wouldn't mind

[Chorus]
'Cause she changed the world I know
And it's better for it
Four years later, and look where we really are
Look how far we've come
And nothing's changed that much

[Bridge]
Look at us now, I'm proud of you
Oh-oh, she's on her way towards me
That means it all gets better soon
I hope my world feels better soon
(I hope my life feels better soon)
You let me do what I needed to
So this one's for you
'Cause even when my worst traits get in the way
You're here to help me feel safe
I don't need to be with anyone else
I don't need to explain
No, I don't need to explain

[Chorus]
She changed the world I know
And it's better for it
Four years later, and look where we really are
She changed the world I know
And it's better for it
She changed the world I know
Look at us now
(She changed the world I know)
I'm dying to see her
(And it's better for it)
Four years later, and look where we really are
(She changed the world I know)
I'm dying to see her
(And it's better for it)
Look at us now[Verse 1]
I'll keep the pictures saved in a safe place
Wow, I look so weird here
My face has changed now
It's a big shame
So many feelings, struggling to leave my mouth
And it's not that rare for me to let myself down
In a big way
But I had enough time and I found enough reason to accept that

[Chorus]
It's not the same anymore
I lost the joy in my face
My life was simple before
I should be happy, of course
But things just got much harder
Now it's just hard to ignore
It's not the same anymore
It's not the same anymore
It's not the same, but, it's not a shame 'cause

[Verse 2]
I spend a long time putting up with people
Putting on my best face
It's only normal when you stop things in the wrong way
It's only four o'clock and still, it's been a long day
I just wanna hit the hay
People knocking on me like every day
I'm tired of taking stress
If only there could be another way
I'm tired of feeling suppressed
And when they want me the most
I'm tired of acting like I care, but I do
And I can't wait to hit the bed
But tomorrow makes me scared

[Chorus]
'Cause it’s not the same anymore
I lost the joy in my face
My life was simple before
I should be happy, of course (Of course)
But things just got much harder
Now it's just hard to ignore
It's not the same anymore (It's not the same)
(It's not the same)
(It's not the same)
It's not the same anymore (It's not the same)
(It's not the same)
(It's not the same)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh
(It's not the same)
(It's not the same)
(It's not the same)
Oh-oh

[Verse 3]
I kept the feelings inside
I open up when shit gets built up this high
She makes it easy to cry
The words fall out of me and there's no more disguise
I miss the days when I was someone else
I used to be so hungry
Right now, my stomach's full as hell
And I've spent many months just hating on myself
I can't keep wishing things will be different
Or leaving problems on the shelf
I wish I didn't need to get help
But I do
But I do
Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 4]
I been so hard on myself, yeah
Even my family can tell
And they barely saw what I felt
I wouldn't wish this on my enemy or anyone else

[Chorus]
It's not the same
(It's not the same)
(It's not the same)
It's not the same as before
It's not the same anymore
And it's fine because

[Verse 5]
I've learned so much from before
Now I'm not short on advice
There's no excuses at all
No point in feeling upset
Won't take my place on the floor
I'll stand up straight like I'm tall
It's up to me, no one else
I'm doing this for myself
It's not the same anymore
It's better
It got better
It's not the same anymore
It's better
Yeah, yeah

Sufjan Stevens,The Decalogue,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=folk"">Folk/Country</a>","It’s hard to believe, but over the last 10 years, Sufjan Stevens has soundtracked twice as many ballets as he’s recorded solo albums. He and choreographer Justin Peck began working together in 2012, when the rising dance star asked Stevens to rework selections from his experimental electronic album Enjoy Your Rabbit for the New York City Ballet. Stevens balked at first, but after George Balanchine’s Stravinsky-scored classics (namely Agon) opened his ears to the expressive possibilities of the form, the singer-songwriter relented, which led to the blossoming of a meaningful creative relationship with Peck.Stevens’ initial hesitation around entering the world of ballet stemmed not only from his qualms with Enjoy Your Rabbit—he downplayed it as “a ramshackle little personal hobby project”—but also his perceptions of ballet itself. “Ballet seemed so anachronistic, so formal and classical and archaic and irrelevant to pop culture,” he said in 2014. Everywhere We Go, the first collaboration with Peck to feature all new, original music, was defined by its intricate arrangements and emphasis on melody, a pointed repudiation of that perceived stuffiness. By contrast, The Decalogue—a borderline academic suite for solo piano, inspired by the Ten Commandments—suggests a self-conscious attempt to compose according to a notion of what contemporary ballet music should sound like. The result is a knotty but welcome entry to Stevens’ discography, albeit one that feels like the result of the artist immersing himself in Peck’s influences rather than the other way round.This new studio recording of The Decalogue, which arrives two years after the debut of Peck’s ballet, does not actually feature Stevens in a performing role. The composer instead opts to have the pianist and contemporary classical composer Timo Andres interpret the score. In Andres’ skilled hands, the pieces move and breathe dynamically, and it’s easy to imagine a cadre of dancers performing pirouettes to the constantly modulating chords. Still, as a standalone piece of music, Decalogue may come across as unusually atonal for any Sufjan fans expecting familiar motifs from their favorite baroque pop polymath, who culled from approximately 50 “impromptu improvisations” to assemble the score.With some exceptions, Decalogue’s piano passages wash over the listener and disappear almost as soon as they materialize. That isn’t to say there are no affecting scenes: The ascendant arpeggios at the beginning of “V” provide an immediately arresting structure for the rest of the piece to flow into. Andres’ execution of the skittering downward runs at the end of “VIII” prove a breathtaking display of musicianship, and the thunderous grand finale in “X” is stirring, if a bit rote. But the album never reveals any whole greater than the sum of its parts, and those parts suffer from a lack of focus.Stevens has said he wanted The Decalogue to be “more pensive and more cerebral, and less explicitly harmonic and melodic” than Everywhere We Go, and he certainly achieves his goal. He’s since moved on from such exercises, describing his most recent work with Peck, Principia, as a middle ground between those prior scores. That new ballet just so happens to feature orchestrations by Andres, a link that implies the pianist isn’t merely a gifted hired gun. Their collaborations may bear more fruit in the years to come, but ultimately The Decalogue is a Stevens curio like Enjoy Your Rabbit and The BQE before it: riveting to diehards, an agreeable footnote for anyone else.--Buy: Rough Trade(Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)",,2019-10-25,6.5
Hana Vu,Nicole Kidman / Anne Hathaway,"<a class=""genre-list__link"" href=""/reviews/albums/?genre=pop"">Pop/R&amp;B</a>","Hana Vu wrote the songs for her dual EP, Nicole Kidman/Anne Hathaway by watching episodes of The Hollywood Reporter’s “The Actress Roundtable” and then conjuring backstories for the women on screen. For Vu, the project’s premise is an entry point for her to do what she does best: crystalize a wisp of an emotion, until the sentiment feels so tactile it could break.Vu’s first EP, the perfectly titled Crying on the Subway, was rooted in bedroom pop, but these EPs explore other genres. She layers and reverbs her vocals on  “Worm” until they sound like a hymn, while “Order” descends into full-on, guitar-thrashing rock. Each track feels like a contained performance, and the lyrics consider the nuanced ways in which acting is tucked into our everyday lives.These aren’t necessarily love songs, and it’s hard to map a narrative onto any track in particular. She wishes someone would cry about her. She croons about “disguises.” “Outside,” which could be a Paramore or Lorde track, comes the closest to feeling personal: “If I look at my phone all day, does it really help my chances?” she asks, waiting for a text that never comes.Vu produced the record herself, and the muted, minimalist fizz matches the distant monotone of her voice. Each track builds around a wrenching line that dissolves into the soundscape. “I’ll never be good enough,” ends the first song, “At the Party,” as a synth sputters and fades. “I wanna be a hero/I want to save you, I wanna save me,” she sings on “Fighter,” with all traces of actual desire drained from her voice.No track on the compact, 10-song project feels unnecessary, but most blend into each other without sounding distinct. (The glaring exception is her cover of “Reflection,” from the Disney movie Mulan, which is thematically relevant but still seems out of place.) That’s not the worst quality in an album that is equally sparse and lush, simple and shimmering, but it shows a space Vu can grow into.",,2019-10-25,7.2
